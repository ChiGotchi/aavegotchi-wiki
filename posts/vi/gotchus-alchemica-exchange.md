The young Gotchi crept up to the entrance of the forbidden tower. Looming in front of him was a large wooden door, full of eldritch carvings and sinister symbols.

The door creaked open, inviting him in.

What he saw spooked him.

Vials. Test Tubes. Flasks.

Each were bubbling and boiling, hissing and churning, glowing with unearthly powers.

Inside, Gotchis were busy haggling with one another.

"How much for a unit of KEK?"

"WTT FOMO for ALPHA"

This, my frens, is the Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX).

## Gotchus Alchemica Exchange

The Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX) is the native Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for Aavegotchi. It is meant to facilitate the trading of [Gotchus Alchemica](/metaverse#gotchus-alchemica) among market participants. GAX will initially support the trading of all GHST-Alchemica pairs.

To incentivize liquidity on GAX, an ERC-20 token called GLMR will be distributed to LPs. GLMR can be spent to reduce the building time of [Installations](/metaverse#building-on-realm-parcels) within the Gotchiverse. More details will follow as it becomes available.

GAX may support non GHST-Alchemica pairs in the future.
