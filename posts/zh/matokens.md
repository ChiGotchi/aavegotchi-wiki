What do you get when you take those interest-bearing aTokens and put them on [Polygon](/glossary#polygon)? Why you get maTokens, of course!

There are multiple ways to get your hands on some maTokens. In this page, we will introduce the various ways.

## Using the Aavegotchi Bridge

This method is used when you have some aTokens on Ethereum Mainnet and want to bridge them to Polygon as maTokens. This method involves paying ETH gas fees (which may be costly).

First, head over to the [Bridge to Polygon](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge) on the Aavegotchi DApp.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/bridge-to-matic.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

Next, click on the token image (circled in red below) to open a dropdown menu of tokens.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/select-atoken-to-convert.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

After selecting the token, key in the amount you want to transfer to Polygon. Using aUSDC as an example, key in the amount you would like to transfer to Polygon in the box highlighted in red.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/amount-to-transfer-to-matic.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

Once you have keyed in the desired amount, click the "Approve Transfer" button. Wait for the transaction to go through on Ethereum.

After the Approve transaction goes through, click the "Transfer to Polygon" button. Wait for this transaction to go through on Ethereum as well.

After you have done that, give it 10 minutes or so for your maTokens to appear in your wallet.

If you are using Metamask and would like to learn how to configure Polygon on it, do check out the [Polygon Guide](/polygon) for step-by-step instructions as to how to do so.

## Bridging through AscendEX

A second (and less costly) method is to transfer funds from CEXes (such as Binance) to AscendEX. From AscendEX, funds could be transferred directly to Polygon. Take a look at the infographic below to see how this could be done!

## Fiat to Polygon using Transak

A third way is to use a fiat-to-Polygon on-ramp.

See this [post](https://trasher.substack.com/p/buying-your-tokens-straight-into) by our community member for a step-by-step guide.

## Staking maTokens into Aavegotchis

Okay, I've gotten myself some maTokens. What now?

Good work fren.

The next step is to purchase a [portal](/portals) using [GHST](/ghst). Portals could be purchased in the Aavegotchi DApp (link will be provided at launch) or on the [Secondary Markets](/marketplace) such as Opensea. Once you've gotten your hands on a precious portal, it is time to begin the summoning process. Upon opening the portal, you will be presented with 10 Gotchis, each with a randomized required maToken/collateral. Here's where the maToken you have acquired comes in. Stake it in the Gotchi that has the same collateral type and bring your fren to life!

For a more detailed explanation of the portal-opening process, check out our [portals](/portals) page.
