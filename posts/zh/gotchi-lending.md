## What is Gotchi Lending?

Gotchi Lending is the Aavegotchi Protocol’s sharing economy, that allows users to lend their Aavegotchi NFTs out to other players for a set period of time.

The owners of the Gotchi are able to set:
* any up-front fees
* the duration of the lending period
* the earnings split

Gotchi Lending is 100% on the blockchain, allowing for the seamless, trustless, and secure sharing of Aavegotchi NFTs.

Gotchi Lending will go live on 28 March 2022

## What can I do with Gotchi Lending?

Gotchi Lending is useful for anyone who own an Aavegotchi. It’s also useful for anyone who wants to play in the soon-to-launch [Gotchiverse](/gotchiverse). Large [guilds](/guild) will be able to utilize the feature to get the NFTs into the hands of their members, and will even have the ability to share earned funds to the guild’s treasury wallet.

Individuals will be able to make use of Gotchi Lending as well, by making their Aavegotchis available publically to earn passive income, or even allowing friends and family to play as their Aavegotchi for no cost.
