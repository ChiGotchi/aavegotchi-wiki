Beyond the Human Realm, there is the Ether Realm, where smart contracts twinkle and dark forests lurk. Travel a bit further down the rabbit hole, and one eventually discovers the Gotchiverse Realm. When a yield farmer in the Ether Realm is liquidated, its spirit journeys to the Gotchiverse, where it reincarnates as an Aavegotchi. Aavegotchis are a spectral species who love nothing more than [farming](/rarity-farming), [voting](/dao), and shitposting with their frens.

The Gotchiverse began with only a handful of Aavegotchis, but as liquidations grew within the Ether Realm, so the population of the Gotchiverse burgeoned, with thousands of Aavegotchis exploring, building, and settling in its vast expanses, and even building great structures to worship the lickquidators, their creators.

## Zones

The Gotchiverse occupies a vast expanse of land, with key landmarks distributed across its geography. It has three distinct zones:

* The Citaadel
* The Grid
* The Beyond

### The Citaadel

Protected by a Force Field that keeps out lickquidators, the Citaadel is the home base of Aavegotchis in the Gotchiverse. Towers cannot be built in the Citaadel, except for in special areas around the Great Portal.

#### The Great Portal

A key landmark within the Citaadel is the the Great Portal. The Great Portal is a structure of impressive magical character, capable of bridging the chasm between the Gotchiverse and the Human Realm. Within the Great Portal swirl the spirits of all Aavegotchis that ever existed. The Great Portal protects the Gotchiverse Citaadel, taking in return a small tithe of the [Gotchus Alchemica](/gotchiverse#gotchus-alchemica) harvested from the Gotchiverse.

### The Grid

The Grid encompasses everything outside of the Citaadel. Parcels in the Grid are much more plentiful, but owners should beware -- lickquidators are lurking in every corner. Grid Parcels can build both Walls and Towers.

#### The Aarena
A key landmark in the Grid is the Aarena.

Although Aavegotchis are frenly, they do realize that aggressive urges need an outlet, which is why they created the Aarena.

Within the Aarena, Aavegotchis with high enough [Spirit Force (Aave-powered interest-bearing aTokens)](/spirit-force) can battle against each other in epic Battle Royales, competing for the Spirit Force of their opponents.

Lickquidators dare not enter into the Aarena, instead opting to frequent the Phantastic Grounds, another friendly-fire area that also allows lickquidators to enter.

### The Beyond

Locked Parcels that will not be unlocked until the beginning of Act 2.

## Districts

Districts comprise of groups of REALM parcels that are situated close to each other. The following image shows a portion of the Citaadel where REALM parcels have been released and the districts in it.

Guilds generally organize themselves in districts. Check out the [Guild page](/guild) for the list of Guilds and which districts they are situated in.

<img src="/gotchiverse/aavegotchi-districts.png" alt="Aavegotchi Districts" />

Browse the REALM here at [gotchiverse.io](https://gotchiverse.io/).

## REALM Parcel Sizes

Parcels come in three sizes, with each size providing greater deposits of Alchemica* and more building space

* Humble: Contain smol deposits of Alchemica and building space (8 x 8 pixels)
* Reasonably Sized: Contain reasonable deposits of Alchemica and building space (16 x 16 pixels)
* Spacious: Contain huge deposits of Alchemica and building space (32 x 64 pixels)

*Exact Material amounts are calculated by [Chainlink VRF](/glossary#chainlink-vrf) upon purchase.

Some parcels will be next to or adjacent to Alchemica deposits. These parcels will see farming boosters indicated on the gotchiverse dashboard and when they are listed on the Baazaar.

To make it more human frenly, each parcel will be assigned with a unique three word combination. This is in addition to the TokenID. Users will be able to use the search box on the Gotchiverse site to specifically filter for parcels with the word or words they are looking for.

## REALM Gameplay

<div class="headerImageContainer">
<img src="/gotchiverse/lickquidator.gif" class="headerImage" alt="Lickquidator">
<p class="headerImageText">Lickquidator</p>
</div>

Owners of REALM parcels can employ their Aavegotchis (and those of others) to farm their REALM parcels, producing quantities of resources known as Gotchus Alchemica. These resources can be combined to create powerful structures known as [Installations](/gotchiverse#building-on-realm-parcels).

The Gotchiverse is an open-ended social space where players can engage in myriad activities, such as farming, crafting, trading, and combat.

Although there are no victory conditions or “end of game” scenarios, one overarching goal of the Gotchiverse is to collect Alchemica to bolster your parcel to produce more yield, and build defensive structures in preparation for the coming of the Prophecy, and the great lickquidators invasion.

Players that possess Lickquidator Credits can opt to play as lickquidators. Lickquidator Credits can be earned by completing tasks, referring friends, participating in airdrops, or other ways. They can also be purchased with [GHST](/ghst).

The main goal of a lickquidator is to collect loose Alchemica that has been spilled around the Gotchiverse, but they can also engage in combat with Aavegotchis and offensive Installations to earn Alchemica.

Lickquidators are envisioned as a free-to-play entry point to the Gotchiverse Realm, with no cap on supply and limited collectability.

There is also a [Gotchi Lending](/gotchi-lending) feature that allows Gotchi owners to lend out their Gotchis to other players for a set period of time to try out the game.

## Socializing in the Gotchiverse

Aavegotchis love socializing with their frens, and their favorite place to hang out is inside the Gotchiverse!

By default, text chat will be enabled for all Gotchis in proximity to each other. REALM Parcel owners can also construct special Installations on their parcels to enable voice chat for Gotchis within a Parcel, and upgrade the Installation to support global voice chat.

Gotchis can also band together to go on Aadventures together, exploring dungeons, fighting lickquidators and other baaddies to earn rewards. Aadventures are special regions outside of the main Gotchiverse where Aavegotchis can put their [traits](/traits) and [wearables](/wearables) to work while exploring, battling NPC enemies, and gaining experience and resources. But they don’t last forever!

## Chat Commands

The following table shows the chat commands in the Gotchiverse.

table_chatCommands

## Gotchus Alchemica

**Gotchus Alchemica** (ERC20 tokens) are the four elements of the Gotchiverse: Fud, Fomo, Alpha, and Kek. They can be combined to craft Installations and Aesthetica, among other uses.

<img class="bodyImage" src="/gotchiverse/gotchus-alchemica.png" alt="Gotchus Alchemica" />

The table below shows their total supply:

table_gotchusAlchemicaSupply

Gotchus Alchemica can be extracted from REALM in four distinct ways:

* **Alchemical Channeling**:  A basic daily stipend earned by Aavegotchis that comes directly from the Gotchiverse ether, instead of being harvested from the parcel.
* **Communal Channeling**: Aavegotchis can also collectively channel Alchemica when a Gotchi Lodge Installation has been built upon the REALM Parcel. In order to participate in communal channeling, the Aavegotchi must be wearing the associated Guild Insignia and be present on the REALM Parcel during the ritual. For every additional Aavegotchi participating in the Communal Channeling ritual, Alchemica will be farmed more rapidly.
* **Farming**: Once a Harvester has been built, Alchemica begin accruing passively, with x amount going into the Reservoir, **y** amount spilling over to the nearby map, and **z** amount going to the Great Portal
* **Harvesting**: Aavegotchis and lickquidators can roam the map, collecting loose Alchemica spilled from mining.

Trading of Gotchus Alchemica will take place on the [Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX)](/gotchus-alchemica-exchange).

The following table shows the estimation for Alchemica concentration per REALM parcel.

<img class="bodyImage" src="/gotchiverse/average-base-alchemica-per-parcel.png" alt="Average Base Alchemica per Parcel" />

25% of the total supply of Alchemica will be distributed during Act I (Citaadel and Grid) via REALM parcel harvesting.

Each Alchemica has unique use cases within the Gotchiverse, and can be used alone or combined with other Alchemica during crafting to form Installations.

During the crafting process, a small portion of Alchemica (5%) is burned forever, whilst the remainder is split between three key sources:

* 40% to The Great Portal, the source of all energy within the Gotchiverse. The Great Portal will accumulate a reserve of Alchemica over time, and any amount excess to this will be recycled back throughout the Gotchiverse via alchemical channeling and other rewarding activities.

* 40% to the [Summoners](/team#summoners), who willed the Gotchiverse into existence. The Summoners are humble and wise and will do everything in their power to promote life within the Gotchiverse.

* 15% to the [AavegotchiDAO](/dao), the stewards and caretakers of the Gotchiverse. They make the Gotchiverse a place worth living in!

## Building on REALM parcels

**Installations** are special structures built on top of your REALM Parcel. Installations are crafted via various combinations of Alchemica, and can be freely traded for GHST in the [Aavegotchi Baazaar](/baazaar).

Confirmed Installations include:

table_installations

Installations take a certain number of blockchain blocks to finish constructing, but this time can be reduced by spending GLMR (GAX Liquidity Mining Rewards), an in-game currency that can be earned by providing liquidity on the Gotchus Alchemica Exchange (GAX).

**Aesthetica** are aesthetic NFTs that can be added to a Parcel, but do not affect its Alchemica or other statistics. They just look dope.

## REALM Tokenomics

### Total Supply

The total supply of REALM is 420,069. Initially, 155,069 REALM will be unlocked and distributed over a period of two years (Act 1). They make up the Citaadel and the Grid. The remaining REALM are currently obscured in an area known as The Beyond. As certain game milestones are reached, these REALM will be unlocked to offer new game experiences (Acts 2-3).

### Distribution

REALM Parcels will be distributed in two main ways:

Method 1: Incentivized GBM Auctions (80%)

The primary distribution method for REALM Parcels will be the incentivized GBM auction system. Participants will be able to select and bid on specific parcels from within the Gotchiverse world map. In a GBM auction, a participant can earn GHST by participating, even if they do not win the NFT. First pioneered by Cryptographs back in 2019, the GBM auction is a patent-pending system, and Pixelcraft Studios has officially been licensed to use it for all Aavegotchi NFT Drops, including Haunt 2, REALM, and even Wearables.

Check out our [Aauction page](/aauction) for more information.

This revolutionary auction model solves many problems inherent to the popular First Come First Serve (FCFS) drops, but they naturally, still favor those with the most capital to invest.

To balance this, the team has decided to raffle off the remaining 20% of REALM parcels using Chainlink VRF-powered Raffles.

Method 2: Raffle (20%)

The secondary distribution method for REALM Parcels will be Chainlink VRF-powered Raffles. Participants will enter via Drop Tickets that are used for Portal and REALM Raffles. Drop Tickets can be earned by holding summoned Aavegotchis, participating in Missions, or by converting FRENS points or other [Raffle tickets](/staking#purchasing-raffle-tickets) at a rate of 10,000 FRENS points per Drop Ticket. Begin accruing FRENS points now by [staking GHST](/staking).

### Drop Tickets

Drop Tickets are ERC-1155 NFTs that are fully tradable on the Aavegotchi [Baazaar](/baazaar). Each Drop Ticket represents **one** entry into the NFT Raffles, where you can win Aavegotchi Portals and REALM Parcels.

<img class="bodyImage" src="/gotchiverse/drop-tickets-and-realm-parcels.png" alt="Aavegotchi Drop Tickets and REALM Parcels" />

There are three ways to get Drop Tickets:

* Convert 10,000 FRENS into one Drop Ticket
* Convert other Raffle Tickets into a Drop Ticket
* Refer your friends to earn Drop Tickets 🔥
