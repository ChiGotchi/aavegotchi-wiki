抵押是指锁定您的加密货币以换取奖励的过程。 在Aavegotchi项目中，这一点没有什么不同。 原生令牌， [GHST](/posts/ghst), 可以被质押在预订合同中赚取 [积分](/posts/glossary#frens)。

FRENS是Aavegotchi Staking Contract内不可转让的余额。 无法购买 FRENS FRENS不可转让，旨在奖励利益相关者对Aavegotchi项目的贡献。

FRENS can be converted into Raffle Tickets or Drop Tickets:

* Raffle Tickets can be entered into periodic [Wearable Raffles](/tickets) to win [Wearables](/wearables).

* Drop Tickets can be entered into [NFT Raffles](/tickets) to win [Portals](/portals) and [REALM Parcels](/metaverse).

## 购买 GHST
首先，你需要拿到一些GHST令牌。 我们的 [GHST 令牌页面](/posts/ghst) 涵盖了您可以获得一些东西的各种方式。

## 如何质押
首先，你需要一些GHST代币来质押。 在Polygon（前Matic网络）上进行押注。

There are four ways to stake:

1. GHST

2. GHST-QUICK

3. GHST-USDC

4. GHST-ETH

**Important: Staking on Mainnet has been discontinued! Please unstake and restake on Polygon.**

*注意：预售的GHST代币在解锁前不能进行质押。*

### 直接质押GHST代币

* Step 1: Transfer your GHST tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, a layer 2 solution using the [Bridge to Polygon Interface](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge).

* Step 2: Approve the contract to use your GHST tokens.

* Step 3: Input the amount of GHST you would like to transfer to Polygon. Once your transaction has confirmed on Ethereum, it takes roughly 7-8 minutes for your balance to reflect on Polygon. Your balance will update automatically. Please be patient!

* Step 4: Configure your Metamask wallet to include Polygon by following this [Polygon Guide](/polygon).

* Step 5: Connect your Metamask to Polygon and go to the [Polygon Staking Page](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon) on the Aavegotchi DApp.

* Step 6: Approve the contract to use your GHST tokens on Polygon.

* Step 7: Input the amount of GHST you would like to deposit. 恭喜你!  你现在完成了!

*For every 1 GHST staked in this way, you receive 1 FRENS / Day.*

### Staking GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC

Staking GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC follows the same steps.

* Step 1: Configure your Metamask wallet to include Polygon by following this [Polygon Guide](/polygon).

* Step 2: Use the [Aavegotchi Bridge](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge) to transfer GHST and/or other assets to Polygon. The [maTokens Guide](/matokens) will show you how this is done.

* Step 3: Become a liquidity provider on either or both the [GHST-QUICK](https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x8b1fd78ad67c7da09b682c5392b65ca7caa101b9) and [GHST-USDC](https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x096c5ccb33cfc5732bcd1f3195c13dbefc4c82f4) pools on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange). You will receive LP tokens in return for your liquidity provision. For people who are interested in staking in the GHST-QUICK pool, you can get some QUICK token from [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange). The most liquid pairs are currently QUICK-UNI, QUICK-WETH, QUICK-USDC, and GHST-QUICK.

* Step 4: Take these LP tokens and stake them in the [Aavegotchi Staking Interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon) to get stkGHST receipt tokens. For the GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC pools, these stkGHST receipt tokens are named stkGHST-QUICK and stkGHST-USDC, respectively.

For the stkGHST-QUICK receipt token **only**, you can stake them into the Quickswap Rewards pool at [https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick) to earn additional QUICK rewards. The Aavegotchi team is requesting for a similar incentive to be offered for the stkGHST-USDC receipt token.

*For every 1 GHST-QUICK LP token staked in this way, you receive 83 FRENS / Day (the team tries to keep the rate around 30-40% higher than just staking GHST alone. This rate is periodically adjusted up/down without warning to maintain the correct proportion).*

*For every 1 GHST-USDC LP token staked in this way, you receive 74 million FRENS / Day (10% more than just staking GHST).*

Why is there a huge difference in the number of FRENS earned through LP staking compared to staking GHST tokens directly? Staking LP tokens have the risk of [impermanent loss](/glossary#impermanent-loss). You are compensated for the increased risk you take.

Why is the GHST-USDC pool yielding 74 million FRENS a day? 早期在QuickSwap上的GHST-USDC池中的一个储户搞错了资产之间的比例。 因此，当储户向池子里添加时，他们会收到极少量的LP代币，比如0.00006。 See this [tweet](https://twitter.com/coderdannn/status/1362423402871447554) for the lulz.

### Staking GHST-ETH

* Step 1: Go to [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/) and choose > Pools > Add Liquidity.

* Step 2: Deposit GHST and ETH equally into the GHST-ETH liquidity pool.

* Step 3: In return, you receive GHST-WETH LP tokens.

* Step 4: Take those LP tokens and stake them at [aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon)

* Step 5: In return, you earn FRENS points and you get stkGHST-WETH tokens

* Step 6: Deposit those at [dinoswap.exchange](https://dinoswap.exchange/) > Fossil Farms to farm DINO

* BONUS: Send your DINO to the GHST Extinction Pool to earn even more GHST!

For every 1 GHST-ETH LP token staked in this way, you receive 12.08 million FRENS / Day (20% more than just staking GHST).

### Staking Returns Table

The table below summarizes the staking returns (in terms of FRENS) in percentage against the baseline of staking GHST directly.

Do note that the Pixelcraft team may update the FRENS amount from time to time to balance the system.

## Staking Contract Addresses

The following table shows the various staking contract addresses on Polygon. The ghstStaking and stkGHSTQUICK contracts share the same contract address. Do check the contract address first before finalizing any transactions.
