嘿，朋友！ So you’ve heard about the migration to Polygon (formerly Matic Network), but got no idea what the hell that even is? 别担心，我们会逐步带你完成所有步骤！

In short, Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for public blockchains like Ethereum. 这是一个去中心化的平台，可确保更快和极低成本的交易，并在主链上具有最终性。 如果你想知道它如何工作更详细，请查看 [文章](https://medium.com/matic-network/what-is-matic-network-466a2c493ae1) 篇。

So say goodbye to $100 transactions on Uniswap and hello to (almost) free interactions!

Moving to Polygon was the right thing to do. [Nick](/team#nick-mudge) found that we have [saved $14.4 million dollars in gas fees from doing so](https://twitter.com/mudgen/status/1372245486535639040).

## Why Polygon?

As you might or might not know, Aavegotchi Mainnet launch was planned for January 4th 2021. On that day Bitcoin moved for almost 40%, which caused arbitrage bots to go crazy. This made gas fees skyrocket to over 400 gwei, resulting in ridiculous transaction fees. Just to put it into perspective: Buying a single [portal](/portals), opening it and summoning a Gotchi would have cost at least 300$.

It was clear that a launch on Ethereum Mainnet was impossible. Since Polygon has been working together with different NFT projects (such as OpenSea) already, the choice was relatively easy. The community shared this sentiment and voted for a launch on Polygon with 76%.

For an extended discussion on this topic, see this medium [post](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/why-aavegotchi-chose-polygon-356238977fb2).

## Adding Polygon to your Metamask

Let’s get started with the fun stuff! To use Polygon, you first need to add it to your Metamask wallet.

1). Open the extension and click the “Ethereum Mainnet” button on the top.

2). 选择“自定义 RPC”。

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/polygon/metamask-custom-RPC.png" alt = "Metamask Custom RPG" />

3). 输入以下设置：

Network Name: Matic Mainnet

New RPC URL: https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/

Chain ID: 137

货币符号(可选)：MATIC

Block Explorer URL (optional): https://explorer.matic.network/

一旦你添加了一切，你可以点击“保存”。

4). There’s no step four, you’re already done! You can now switch between Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon by clicking the button from step 1.

## Matic Faucet

You need MATIC tokens to transact on Polygon.

Here are some MATIC faucets that will give you some free MATIC to do transactions:

* [Matic Supply](https://matic.supply/)

* [Mac&Cheese Finance Matic Faucet](https://macncheese.finance/matic-polygon-mainnet-faucet.php)

If the faucets do not work, drop in to the Aavegotchi Discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6) and head over to the #matic-requests channel and some of our frenly frens will provide you with some MATIC.
