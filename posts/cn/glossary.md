## Aavegotchi 相关内容

### Aavegotchi
Aavegotchis是生活在以太坊区块链上的像素幽灵，使用 ERC-721 标准。 它的属性由稀有度决定, 通过多重因素计算, 例如基础特性、 收藏品数量、 以及穿戴 [可穿戴的装备](/rarity-farming)。

### FRENS
积分被奖励给已质押GHST的用户。 FRENS 不是一个令牌。 从技术上讲，这是放样合同中的余额。 FRENS不可转让，旨在奖励利益相关者对Aavegotchi项目的贡献。

### 灵魂力
灵魂力是指锁定在gotchi中的抵押品（aToken）的数量。

### 精神点
灵魂点指的是等级上升时得到的点。 Kinda就像RPG游戏中的统计点。 你每3级获得1个精神点。

### 可穿戴装备
Aavegotchi穿的衣服/设备。 它们符合ERC-1155标准。

## DeFi 101

"DeFi" 是指 **去**中心化**金融**nance. 可以认为它是为传统金融机构提供类似服务的应用程序和协议的生态系统（例如，借贷，借贷以及从储蓄中产生的利息等）。 但是，有一个主要区别-DeFi的目标是在没有中间人的情况下以分散的方式进行。


这意味着没有银行削减您的潜在收益或为您提供负利率。 这也意味着不会出现整个系统可能崩溃的中心故障点，也不会受到由集中力量的小组决定和实施的一组规则的影响。


在撰写本文时（2020年12月5日），锁定Defi的总价值为14.24B USD。

## 用户条款

### APY
APY代表年收益率。 这是您存入协议的储蓄所赚取的实际收益率，同时考虑了加息的影响。

### aTokens
aTokens are interest-bearing tokens from the [Aave Protocol](https://aave.com/). For step-by-step instructions as to how to get aTokens, please refer to our [aTokens](/atokens) page.

### 抵押品
Collateral is a pretty straightforward concept. It refers to an asset you might put down as a form of guarantee to a lender, when borrowing money from them. If you cannot pay back your loan, your collateral will be used to pay your debt.


In the context of DeFi, this is how things might look:


Let's say you want to borrow some assets from a protocol. For this to happen, you will need to set down a portion of your other assets as collateral. If you don't pay your loan back, the protocol will not release your collateral back to you.

In the Aavegotchi metaverse, collaterals are also known as [Spirit Force](/glossary#spirit-force).

### DAICO
Stands for Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offering. It is a new fundraising method that seeks to incorporate the best features of a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](/glossary#dao) with those of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to create a structure that provides a higher level of effectiveness to the token sale fundraising model. DAICO是一种自治模式，在募资结束后，投资者对募集的资金拥有控制权。 投资者可以通过 "水龙头 "机制影响开发者如何获得资金，以及以何种频率获得资金。 此外，投资者还可以投票决定是否取消项目，并将资金返还。

### DAO
Otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. These are organizations that are organizations governed by rules as encoded by smart contracts and controlled by its members. This is as opposed to traditional organizational models, which often tend to be governed by a small group of authority figures.

In the context of the AavegotchiDAO, what this means is that members of the ecosystem will be able to initiate and vote on proposals that will influence how the larger ecosystem will run. For instance, members might propose to increase the number of Portals available over time, amongst any other feature that they feel would help improve the community.

For more a more detailed explainer on DAOs, check out [this page](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/) .



### DEX
Otherwise known as a Decentralized Exchange. Such platforms allow users to handle transactions in a peer-to-peer manner, to obtain tokens through a user's own wallet with the help of smart contracts. This is as opposed to the way CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) work, which operate through a middleman (the CEX itself).


Some examples of DEXs include UniSwap, Mesa and Balancer.


Some examples of CEXs include Binance, Coinbase and OKex.


### 闪电贷
Remember what we mentioned above about loans and collaterals? Well, flash loans are a form of loan that get around that need for putting down collateral. However, there's a catch.

The flash loan has to be repaid within the same transaction block.

If this doesn't happen, the whole transaction is reversed to effectively undo the actions executed up until that point. You can read more about Flash Loans [here](https://aave.com/flash-loans/).



### 无常损失
Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a pool (see [Liquidity Pools](/glossary#liquidity-pools)), and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. This would result in a loss if, at the point in time you wish to withdraw your assets, the price has decreased from when you first deposited them. This leads to a lower dollar value at the time of your withdrawal.



### 流动性矿池
The term is somewhat self-explanatory. These are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. They are in turn used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.


For a more detailed breakdown of these terms, check out Finematics's [guide](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/).

### maTokens
maTokens are [aTokens](/glossary#atokens) on [Polygon](/glossary#polygon). They are developed by our very own [Nick Mudge](/team#nick-mudge).

For step-by-step instructions on how to convert aTokens on Ethereum Mainnet to maTokens on Polygon, do refer to this [maTokens](/matokens) guide.

### 预言机
In order for Smart Contracts to execute, certain conditions need to be met. Information about the presence of these conditions needs to be fed to the blockchain that the contract is on. This is because blockchains typically do not have ready access to information outside of the chain. This is where oracles come into the picture. These entities provide the necessary data to trigger smart contracts.



### 智能合约
Generally speaking, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the "terms of agreement" between the users of the contract being directly written into the code of the contract itself. When these predetermined terms and certain conditions are met, the contract executes.



### Staking
Staking a cryptocurrency essentially means to hold that currency, to help verify transactions and support the network. In exchange for doing so, stakers typically receive some kind of reward. In the Aavegotchi world for instance, $GHST stakers are rewarded with FRENS (points) that they can use to buy tickets and win prizes in periodic raffles.



### 挖矿
Very simply put, yield farming is a practice that allows users to earn rewards by depositing and lending their assets in a particular protocol.

This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most common mechanism is when depositers/borrowers earn coins from a protocol, by simply staking their ERC-20 tokens and/or stable coins on its platform. Usually, these rewards are used to incentivize potential depositers and borrowers to add liquidity to a particular platform.


## 通用术语

### Aragon
Aragon is an open-source, community-driven project with the mission to empower freedom by creating tools for decentralized organizations to thrive.

The flagship product of the project is the Aragon client, a tool for creating and participating in decentralized organizations on Ethereum. The project is also building the Aragon Network, the world's first digital jurisdiction.

The Aragon project is stewarded by the Aragon Association, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and governed by Aragon Network Token holders.

Check out their [site](https://aragon.org/) here.

### 钟形曲线
A bell curve is a common type of distribution for a variable, also known as the normal distribution. The term "bell curve" originates from the fact that the graph used to depict a normal distribution consists of a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. See this [page](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bell-curve.asp) for more information.

### Chainlink VRF
A Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) developed by Chainlink to generate randomness that is verifiable on-chain. It is used to provide proof that smart contracts are indeed using a tamper-proof source of randomness beyond their control. In the Aavegotchi project, the Chainlink VRF is used to randomize the generation of [traits](/traits) at the point of [portal](/portals) opening and raffle prizes.

Read more about the Chainlink VRF [here](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/).

### Diamond Standard
The Diamond Standard is created by our very own [Nick Mudge](/team#nick-mudge). The Diamond Standard enables people to write contracts with virtually no size limit in a modular and gas-efficient way.

Diamonds can be upgraded on the fly without having to redeploy existing functionality.

Standardizes contract interfaces and implementation details of diamonds, enabling software integration and interoperability.

A diamond is a contract that implements the Specification in this standard.

See [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) for more information.

### ERC-20
A token standard for fungible token, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token. It provides functionalities such as transferring tokens from one account to another, getting the current token balance of an account and also the total supply of the token available on the network. Besides these, it also has some other functionalities such as approving an amount of tokens that can be spent by a third party account. See [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) for more information.

### ERC-721
A free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.

Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.

For a full explanation of what the ERC-721 standard entails, check it out [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

### ERC-998
ERC-998 is an extension to the [ERC-721](/glossary#erc-721) standard that adds the ability for [non-fungible tokens](/glossary#nft) to own other non-fungible tokens and ERC-20 tokens.

Non-fungible tokens that implement ERC998 also implement the ERC-721 standard.

For a full explanation of what the ERC-998 standard entails, check it out [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-998).

### Metaverse

A metaverse is a virtual world where you can interact with aspects of the world itself (like games or shops) as well as with other users.

Some examples of metaverses include the <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse">Aavegotchi Realm</a> in addition to projects like Second Life and Decentraland.

### Non-Fungible Token

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something **unique**, meaning it cannot be swapped out for any other token. Non-fungible tokens typically represent ownership of items such as wearables, works of art, or any other type of property.

The **opposite** of a non-fungible token is one that can be exchanged for any other of its kind, like USDC or Bitcoin. Tokens that can be swapped 1:1 for a coin of the same kind are known as fungible tokens.

### Polygon
Polygon (Formerly Matic Network) is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation, Polygon supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

To transfer tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, please refer to this [guide](/polygon).

Read more about Polygon [here](https://matic.network/).

### Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a kind of consensus mechanism that blockchains can use to agree upon a single true record of data history. In a PoS blockchain, validators commit stake to attest (or ‘validate’) blocks into existence.

Validators are the participants on the network who run nodes (called validator nodes) to propose and attest blocks on a PoS blockchain. They do so by staking crypto (in the case of Ethereum 2.0, ETH) on the network and make themselves available to be randomly selected to propose a block. Other validators then “attest” that they have seen the block. When a sufficient number of attestations for the block has been collected, the block is added to the blockchain. Validators receive rewards both for successfully proposing blocks (just as they do in PoW) and for making attestations about blocks that they have seen.

Read more about the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism [here](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-proof-of-stake/).

### QuickSwap

QuickSwap is a permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX) based on Ethereum, powered by [Polygon](/glossary#polygon)’s Layer 2 scalability infrastructure. By utilizing Layer 2 for transactions, QuickSwap users will be able to trade any ERC20 asset at lightning-fast speeds with near-zero gas costs.

QuickSwap can be accessed [here](https://quickswap.exchange).
