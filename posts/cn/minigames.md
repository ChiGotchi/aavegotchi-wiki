What’s the fun of owning an Aavegotchi if you can’t play with it? One of the core experiences of the Aavegotchi game will be exploring the Aavegotchi [Realm](/metaverse) overworld with friends and pitting your Aavegotchis against theirs.

Some mini-games will be played using simple random number generators (RNGs), whereas others will offer more immersive, player-controlled experiences.

Each mini-game will use different Aavegotchi traits to enable fair gameplay for a wide variety of trait distributions. For example, a HYPER-AGGRESSIVE Aavegotchi may perform well in an Aavegotchi Fight Club, but may not be well-suited to a cake-baking mini-game.

Have an Aavegotchi that isn’t suited well to any mini-game currently offered? Jump in and develop one! To help support developers building Aavegotchi mini-games, [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) V2.0 will manage a Development Fund that has been set up for supporting development work carried out within the Aavegotchi ecosystem. As long as mini-games conform to trait distribution standards, they can reward winners with XP.
