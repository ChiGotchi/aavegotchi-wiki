Kinship is your Aavegotchi’s feeling of loyalty towards you. Kinship is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value (50) upon summon and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it. The minimum kinship value is 0. There is no maximum kinship value.

Typically, longer ownership equals higher kinship, but neglecting your Aavegotchi for long periods of time will lower its kinship level. Aavegotchis aren’t just vessels to store your crypto bags. They’re living, breathing ghosts, and they need your affection!

A maximum of 1 Kinship point is accrued for every 12 hour period in which you interact with your Aavegotchi. Conversely, there will be a -1 Kinship point penalty if your Aavegotchi is left unengaged for 24 hours.

Kinship exists as an internal balance on the Aavegotchi smart contract.

Potions could also be used to improve kinship scores. However, they are limited edition consumables and may not always be available in the Aavegotchi store. More details on potions will be available soon.

High kinship levels can boost your Aavegotchi’s performance in mini-games, and may also act as a multiplier for GHST rewards on governance and [rarity farming](/rarity-farming). Low kinship levels will have the opposite effect.

Some ways to boost your Aavegotchi’s kinship level:

* Aavegotchis是带着公民责任感出生的。 将你的Aavegotchi带到市政厅，让它在AavegotchiDAO投票；
* Aavegotchis可能是小鬼，但他们有着贪婪的欲望！ 给他们喂食Aavegotchi消费品，让他们展开笑颜；
* Aavegotchis喜欢尝试新衣服。 给你的Aavegotchi穿上新装备，以形成一种持久的纽带；
* Aavegotchis喜欢玩！ 带着你的Aavegotchi在Aavegotchi领域里溜一溜，玩玩小游戏从而提升它的等级。

The table below shows the kinship level and their value range.
