</div>

Kinship is your Aavegotchi’s feeling of loyalty towards you. Kinship is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value (50) upon summon and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it. The minimum kinship value is 0. There is no maximum kinship value.

Typically, longer ownership equals higher kinship, but neglecting your Aavegotchi for long periods of time will lower its kinship level. Aavegotchis aren’t just vessels to store your crypto bags. They’re living, breathing ghosts, and they need your affection!

A maximum of 1 Kinship point is accrued for every 12 hour period in which you interact with your Aavegotchi. Conversely, there will be a -1 Kinship point penalty if your Aavegotchi is left unengaged for 24 hours.

Kinship exists as an internal balance on the Aavegotchi smart contract.

Potions could also be used to improve kinship scores. However, they are limited edition consumables and may not always be available in the Aavegotchi store. More details on potions will be available soon.

High kinship levels can boost your Aavegotchi’s performance in mini-games, and may also act as a multiplier for GHST rewards on governance and [rarity farming](/rarity-farming). Low kinship levels will have the opposite effect.

Some ways to boost your Aavegotchi’s kinship level:

* Aavegotchis are born with a sense of civic duty. Bring your Aavegotchi to City Hall and let it vote in AavegotchiDAO;
* Aavegotchis may be ghosts, but they have voracious appetites! Feed your Aavegotchi consumables to see its spooky smile;
* Aavegotchis love trying on new clothes. Equip your Aavegotchi with new wearables to forge a lasting bond;
* Aavegotchis love to play! Take your Aavegotchi out for a romp in the Aavegotchi Realm and level it up playing mini-games.

The table below shows the kinship level and their value range.
