## ¿Qué es el alquiler de Gotchis?

El alquiler de Gotchi es la economía compartida del Protocolo de Aavegotchi. que permite a los usuarios prestar sus NFTs Aavegotchi a otros jugadores durante un periodo de tiempo determinado.

Los propietarios de los Gotchi pueden establecer:
* cualquier comisión inicial
* la duración del período de préstamo (máximo de 30 días)
* la división de ganancias

Gotchi Lending is 100% on the blockchain, allowing for the seamless, trustless, and secure sharing of Aavegotchi NFTs.

## ¿Qué puedo hacer con el alquiler de Gotchi?

Gotchi Lending is useful for anyone who own an Aavegotchi. It’s also useful for anyone who wants to play in the soon-to-launch [Gotchiverse](/gotchiverse). Large [guilds](/guild) will be able to utilize the feature to get the NFTs into the hands of their members, and will even have the ability to share earned funds to the guild’s treasury wallet.

Individuals will be able to make use of Gotchi Lending as well, by making their Aavegotchis available publically to earn passive income, or even allowing friends and family to play as their Aavegotchi for no cost.

## Instrucciones para Prestamistas

**Step 1: Set the Duration and Upfront Cost**

First the lender will set any upfront costs, the lending duration, and which tokens to share with the borrower. Whether to charge an upfront cost or not is up to the owner and the market. The majority of lenders will likely not charge an upfront cost, allowing anyone to use their Aavegotchis for free!

Lenders will be able to select which tokens to share with borrowers. This means a lender can choose to offer a sharing rate on some tokens and not others. For example, a lender can choose to offer a 100% sharing rate on one token, but not share any others. Alternatively, they could elect to share 50% of each.

Additionally, the token sharing options now include GHST in addition to the four types of Gotchus Alchemica. This is particularly important during Rarity Farming seasons, because lenders will get to determine what, if any, portion of an Aavegotchi’s GHST balance they wish to share.

The lender could also specify a whitelist ID containing the addresses that are eligible to borrow the Gotchi. You can find your whitelist ID in the [whitelists page](https://app.aavegotchi.com/whitelists).

**Bonus Step:**

Lenders will also have the ability to create [whitelists](https://app.aavegotchi.com/whitelists), making their Aavegotchis available only to an exclusive group of borrowers. This feature is perfect for guilds who want to make sure their Aavegotchi NFTs get into the hands of members of their guild.

On the other side of the coin, borrowers will have a number of filters at their disposal to allow them to find the Aavegotchi that best suits their needs. Aavegotchis available to borrow can be filtered by earnings split, upfront cost, duration, and shared tokens.
