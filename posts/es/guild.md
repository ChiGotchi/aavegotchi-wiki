## Accediendo a un clan

Gotchi Lodges será accesible a Gotchis con un "Guild Crest" (emblema del clan) Una Guild Crest es un NFT particular que debe ser llevado o equipado por un Aavegotchi.

By default, Gotchi Lodges will be accessible to any Gotchi with the proper Guild Crest in its Pocket (open access), but Guilds can also restrict access to certain Gotchi IDs by requiring Aavegotchis to apply for membership (restricted access) or even designating which Aavegotchis can apply for membership (whitelisting).

There are 2 types of Guild Crests:

* **Wearables Crests**: An established Aavegotchi protocol ERC-1155 [Wearables](/wearables) (such as Common Rofl, or Aave Hero Mask) with limited supply.

* **Insignia Crests**: Special ERC-1155 NFTs without a fixed quantity that can be minted by Guild Owners and held by Aavegotchi members to allow access into a Gotchi Lodge.

Each Gotchi Lodge can link one Insignia Crest and up to three Wearable Crests. The main difference between the two Crests is that **Wearable Crests** endow Guild Channeling privileges, whereas **Insignia Crests** only allow Guild access.

## Guild Channeling

Guild Channeling (also known as Communal Channeling) is a ritual that Guild members can engage in every week to summon Alchemica to rain down nearby from the Gotchiverse.

Alchemica earned is dependent on the following 3 factors:

* **Base Channel Rate** – how much Alchemica is allocated, before any modifications

* **Gotchi Presence** – how many Guild members are present

* **Wearable Crest Rarity** – the rarity of the Wearable used for channeling

The Base Channel Rate will initially be set at 20 FUD, 10 FOMO, 5 ALPHA, and 2 KEK. This Rate may need to be adjusted by the community over time to prevent going over the Alchemica budget for Alchemical Channeling (25% of total supply over the lifetime of the game, 50% of which is allocated to Guild Channeling).

Every extra Aavegotchi holding the designated Wearable that joins in the ritual increases the total by the Base Channel Rate **Gotchi Presence**, which results in exponentially more Alchemica being dropped:

**Wearable Crest Rarity Multiplier** designates the base rate at which Alchemica is dropped:

## Vincular tu clan a un Crest

*Wearable Crests*

A Gotchi Lodge has to link with a Wearable Crest on-chain before it can engage in Alchemical Channeling. Initially, only **one** Guild can use each Wearable.

A Gotchi Lodge will be considered “linked” with its Wearable Crest if its [REALM parcel](/gotchiverse#realm-parcel-sizes) holds a special ERC-1155 Wearable Crest NFT onchain.

This ERC-1155 Crest cannot be purchased off the open market, but must be won in a [Bid-to-earn Auction](/aauction) using GLTR. Auctions will be held every **three months** for all Wearable Crests, and the winners of those auctions will automatically be transferred the Wearable Crests on-chain, thus earning their Guild the privilege to engage in Guild Channeling.

This gives a strong incentive for Guilds to hold and LP their Alchemica, to continue earning GLTR, and providing Guild Channeling for their members.

*Insignia Crests*

Each Gotchi Lodge can mint an onchain ERC-1155 Insignia Crest for its members, to allow access to the Lodge without holding the Wearable Crest. The Lodge owner can update the Crest metadata to change the name and appearance of the Crest, but not the Crest’s onchain ID.
