</div>

Une [DAO](glossary#dao) est une forme d√©centralis√©e de gouvernance, qui permet aux d√©tenteurs de jetons de voter afin de choisir la fa√ßon dont l'organisation prend des d√©cisions.

Aavegotchi suit les traces de protocoles DeFi r√©ussis tels que Compound et Synthetix en suivant un processus de ¬´ d√©centralisation progressive ¬ª, en commen√ßant par l'√©quipe fondatrice, Pixelcraft Studios organisant un √©v√©nement de distribution de jetons (DAICO) dirig√© par la DAO et culminant en pla√ßant la gouvernance d'Aavegotchi, y compris tous les m√©canismes de jeu, les contrats intelligents, et le financement, sous les auspices de l'AavegotchiDAO, mais toujours soumis √† l'environnement r√©glementaire dominant. Cela se fera en trois phases.

## Gen√®se

*Voir* [DAICO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/curve/#aavegotchi-daico).

La premi√®re it√©ration du AavegotchiDAO a √©t√© lanc√©e en tandem avec la distribution GHST sur la courbe de liaison. Les d√©tenteurs de GHST ont eu le pouvoir de voter pour augmenter / maintenir les fonds distribu√©s par le m√©canisme de la [courbe de liaison de jetons (TBC)](/curve) r√©serv√© √† Pixelcraft Studios (l'√©quipe derri√®re Aavegotchi) pour soutenir le d√©veloppement. La premi√®re proposition AavegotchiDAO d'augmenter le "tapage" d'Aavegotchi DAICO √† partir de 50, 00 DAI √† 100 000 DAI par mois est pass√©s avec une approbation de 99 % le 18 octobre 2020. Lorsque le moment sera venu de migrer vers AavegotchiDAO Metamorphose, les d√©tenteurs de jetons voteront √©galement pour effectuer la migration.

Les d√©tenteurs de jetons ne recevront pas de r√©compenses en GHST pour leur participation active √† cette it√©ration d'AavegotchiDAO.

Les caract√©ristiques de la Gen√®se comprennent :

* Aucun appel de smart contract
* Aucune am√©lioration du contrat
* Gouvernance bas√©e sur les jetons GHST
* Plateforme: Aragon
* R√©compenses : Aucune
* Couche : R√©seau principal Ethereum

## Cocon

V1.5 d'AavegotchiDAO. Le point interm√©diaire entre [Gen√®se](/dao#genesis) et [M√©tamorphose](/dao#metamorphosis). La priorit√© l'√©tape Cocoon est d'influencer la m√©canique du jeu.

Its features include:

* Contract calls called by Pixelcraft
* Aucune am√©lioration du contrat
* Gouvernance bas√©e sur les jetons GHST
* Platform: Snapshot/Discourse
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) for Core Votes
* Layer: Polygon

There are 2 types of voting in the Cocoon stage: (1) Signal Proposal, and (2) Core Proposal.

A Signal Proposal can be posted by anyone to the Community tab on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/aavegotchi.eth). These votes are non-binding, but if quorum is achieved, the proposal will automatically be upgraded into a binding Core Proposal. Before you come up with a Signal Proposal, it is mandatory to discuss it with the community on Discord and/or [Discourse/AavegotchiDAO Forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/). The rationale is to ideate further and to discover whether there is worthy support to move forward with the Signal Proposal. Please follow the template found in the [Creating Signal Proposals section](/dao#creating-signal-proposals).

The Signal Proposal will be upgraded to a Core Proposal once the former passes with a quorum reaching 20% of circulating GHST eligible to vote on Polygon at the time of proposal creation.

A Core Proposal is a proposal that Pixelcraft puts forward, with options based on Signal Proposals that reached or nearly reached quorum. These votes are binding and are eligible for XP rewards to participants.

If your Signal Proposal is successfully upgraded to a Core Proposal, 150 [XP](/traits#experience)* will be given to the Aavegotchi you have noted in your Signal Proposal.

*May increase or decrease throughout COCOON period

## M√©tamorphose

Metamorphosis is the second iteration of AavegotchiDAO, and is charged with managing simple game mechanics of Aavegotchi, such as the total supply of Aavegotchis, adding new collaterals, deciding on their functions, and adding new wearables created by the community. When the time comes to migrate to AavegotchiDAO Oasis, the AavegotchiDAO will again vote to perform the migration.

A full list of actions available to perform by the AavegotchiDAO in this phase is available in the [Governance](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/governance) section of the Aavegotchi smart contract documentation.

Token holders will receive rewards in the form of GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.

Its features include:

* Can execute smart contract calls
* Can upgrade certain mechanics
* Aavegotchi + GHST governance
* Platform: Custom dapp front-end
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) + badges for voting
* Layer: Polygon

## Oasis

Although AavegotchiDAO Oasis is the final iteration of AavegotchiDAO‚Äôs evolution, it is only the beginning of the realization of a DAO-governed game. All decisions related to Aavegotchi game mechanics, REALM mechanics, ecosystem spending, and even smart contract upgrades will be voted on by the AavegotchiDAO.

Token holders will receive rewards in GHST for active participation in this iteration of AavegotchiDAO.

Its features include:

* Can execute smart contract calls
* Can upgrade certain mechanics
* Aavegotchi + GHST governance
* Platform: Aavegotchi Realm
* Rewards: [XP](/traits#experience) + badges for voting
* Layer: Polygon

## Participer √† la gouvernance
I'm psyched up! So how do I participate in the AavegotchiDAO? Fren, we got you covered!

* You can participate in the discussions in the [AavegotchiDAO forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/) or the #üå±dao-discussion channel on Discord. We welcome everyone!

* Taking part in AavegotchiDAO votes (when they are available!)

* The [Aavegotchi Docs](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/governance) details the list of DAO functions that members can call/use in order to implement changes that have been voted in. For example, let's say that asUSD has been voted in as a [collateral type](/posts/atokens). AavegotchiDAO could implement the change by using the `addCollateralTypes()` function and specifying asUSD within the function.

## Forum AavegotchiDAO

The AavegotchiDAO Governance Forum is powered by Discourse. Having this forum will help centralize discussion on important topics related to Aavegotchi game mechanics, funding requests, and other proposals.

We hope that #GotchiGang can become a model for DAO-owned games in the future, so get involved and remember to be frenly to your fellows.

The Forum can be found [here](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/).

## Type de propositions

There are 2 types of proposals in the *Cocoon* stage:

* **Signal Proposal** ‚Äî A proposal that can be posted by anyone. These votes are non-binding, but if quorum is achieved, the proposal will automatically be upgraded into a binding Core Proposal. Share your proposal idea and discuss it with other community members on the #üå±dao-discussion channel on Discord or on the [AavegotchiDAO Forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/). Once you have finalized the details of your proposal, create an official thread for it on the AavegotchiDAO forum using the framework outlined in the [Creating Signal Proposals](/dao#creating-signal-proposals) section below. After which, create a vote for it on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/aavegotchi.eth).

* **Core Proposal** ‚Äî If a Signal Proposal achieves 20% or greater quorum (amount of circulating GHST eligible to vote on Polygon), Pixelcraft will reintroduce the proposal as a Core Proposal. These votes are binding and are eligible for [XP](/traits#experience) rewards to participants.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/proposal-type.png" alt = "AavegotchiDAO Proposal Type" />

**Core Proposals** are further subdivided into 3 types:

*Reminder: Quorum percentages are calculated from the amount of circulating GHST eligible to vote on Polygon, not the total supply!*

* **Smol votes:** Quorum of 5%. These votes are intended for small decisions that do not affect the overall meta or value of existing Aavegotchis in any significant way (e.g. introduction of a cosmetic feature, proposal for a marketing strategy).

* **Medium votes:** Quorum of 10%. These votes are intended for decisions that may have some notable effect on the meta (e.g. introducing a new game item, allocating XP to some item or event, changing something about an Aavegotchi that does not affect its rarity score).

* **Galaxy votes:** Quorum of 20%. These votes are intended for major decisions that have significant effects on the meta and wider Aavegotchi ecosystem (e.g. a new Haunt, changing something about an Aavegotchi that affects its rarity score).

## Diff√©rences de vote

Vote differentials are the difference between the top two options, and are indicative of whether or not a reasonable consensus has been achieved.

Here is an example Core Proposal with 3 options:

* Option A receives 25%
* Option B receives 35%
* Option C receives 40%.

The required Vote Differential is 5% (the difference between Option C [40%] and Option B [35%]).

This would not be enough to achieve consensus, thus the Proposal is not implemented.

Typically, the more options a vote has, the higher Vote Differential it requires to demonstrate that true consensus has been reached.

For COCOON, we will begin with the following Vote Differential parameters, and course correct if necessary:

2 Options ‚Äî 10% VD

3 Options ‚Äî 15% VD

4 Options ‚Äî 20% VD

## Cr√©ation de propositions Signal

To create signal proposals for the #GotchiGang to vote on, please adhere to the following format:

* Author + GotchiID
* Link to the matching Discourse thread (Proposals without significant discussion in the forum will be automatically removed from Snapshot)
* Summary (include rationale, timeline, goals and any key performance indicators) Copy/paste proposals of existing proposals will be removed while proposals with similar but distinct variations are permitted to exist side by side.
* Effect
* Highlight end goal and benefits
* Acknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences
* Any alternative paths (Plan B, Plan C, etc)
* The end time of a proposal should not be longer than 30 days from its starting time, to ensure that only active proposals are displayed on Snapshot Community board.

More details can be found in this [Medium post](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/scaling-aavegotchidao-c7e589de0333).

## Vote

There are two ways to vote: (1) Snapshot Voting, and/or (2) Aragon Voting.

### Snapshot Voting

Snapshot is a voting DApp on Ethereum. Votes made on Snapshot does not require any gas and are not on-chain. Aavegotchi's Snapshot page can be found [here](https://snapshot.page/#/aavegotchi.eth).

To vote on Snapshot, follow the steps below:

1). Go to an open proposal.

2). Connect your wallet.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot1.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />
<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot2.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />

3). Select a poll option, and click "Vote." A pop-up will appear to confirm your choice.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot3.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />
<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot4.jpg" alt = "Snapshot Voting Ethereum" />

4). Your Metamask will pop up. Sign the transaction, and you're done!

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/snapshot5.jpg" alt = "sign transaction on Snapshot Voting" />

### Aragon Voting

Aragon is a tool for creating and participating in decentralized organizations on Ethereum. Votes made on Aragon requires gas and exists on-chain.

Aavegotchi's Aragon page can be found [here](https://client.aragon.org/#/aavegotchi/0xf63e1edbcb3be8d5fb124f4a228f5412f48e5ae7/).

To vote on Aragon, follow the steps below:

1). Go to an open proposal.

2). Connect your wallet.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/aragon1.jpg" alt = "Aragon Voting Ethereum" />

3). Choose to vote "Yes" or "No."

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/dao/aragon2.jpg" alt = "Aragon Voting Ethereum" />

4). A Metamask transaction will pop-up. Take note that your transaction has to be mined to be confirmed, so consult a site like [gasnow](https://gasnow.org/) for the latest gas price.

5). Once your transaction is mined, your vote will be reflected accordingly.

## Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals (AGIPs)

See those votes on Aragon? They are Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals (AGIPs)!

Visit the [Aavegotchi Improvement Proposals](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals) page for a list of historical votes. If you'd like to be informed of future proposals, follow [Aavegotchi on social media](/socialmedia).

Vote on AGIPs and get [POAP badges](/poap) for it!

## Tr√©sorerie

AavegotchiDAO earns 0.3% of all trades on the Aavegotchi [Bonding Curve](/curve) on Ethereum Mainnet. This is the current source of all DAO funds.

As responsible stewards, members of AavegotchiDAO will play a role in determining how these funds are to be allocated.

The AavegotchiDAO treasury is located [here](https://aavegotchi.com/treasury).
