## Algemene Veelgestelde Vragen


### Ik ben nieuw in Aavegotchi. Hoe speel ik na de lancering?

* **STEP 1:** Buy [GHST](/ghst)

* **STEP 2:** Use GHST to buy a [portal](/portals) or an Aavegotchi from the [Baazaar](/baazaar)

* **STEP 3:** Get some wearables for your Gotchi from the Baazaar

* **STEP 4:** Pet your Gotchi every 12 hours to increase his/her [kinship](/traits#kinship)

* **STEP 5:** Participate in [Rarity Farming](/rarity-farming)

* **STEP 6:** Play some [Mini-Games](/minigames)

* **STEP 7:** Wait for the [Gotchiverse](/gotchiverse) to roll out!

You can find an in-depth outline of gameplay <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/gameplay" target = "_blank">here.</a>

### Wanneer kan ik een Aavegotchi krijgen?

2 March 2021 on Polygon! The [Gotchiverse](/gotchiverse) will open shortly after (Q1 2021).

### Hoeveel kost het om Aavegotchi te spelen?
There are a couple of ways to get an Aavegotchi:

* Buy a [portal](/portals) during a portal drop, open it, and [claim](/portals#claiming-an-aavegotchi) the Gotchi by staking the minimum required amount of Spirit Force.

Cost: 100 GHST + 10 DAI worth of collateral minimum (you might need more collateral if you pick a rarer Gotchi from the portal). This option is viable only during portal drops as they get swiped out very quickly.

* Buy an Unopened Portal at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable.

* Buy an Opened Portal at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable, but cheaper than Unopened Portals bought at the Baazaar since the 10 Gotchis in it are already revealed.

* Buy an Aavegotchi from someone else selling it at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable. Depends on the rarity of the Gotchi, whether it comes with wearables, Baadges, etc.

### Wanneer is de mainnet lancering?
Mainnet was originally scheduled for launch on 4 January 2021. Due to high congestion on the Ethereum blockchain at that point, a community vote was put into action. The community voted for the launch of Aavegotchi on Polygon at a later date. The Aavegotchi team has confirmed the 2 March 2021 launch date on Polygon.


### Wat kan ik nu doen?

Right now, you can:

* **Stake GHST to earn FRENS:** FRENS can be used to purchase raffle tickets to be used in Raffles. Check out the [Staking page](/staking) for more info!

* **Pet your Gotchi evey 12 hours:** Yes! You need to build [Kinship](/traits#kinship) with your Gotchi fren too! The higher the Kinship, the better you do in [Rarity Farming](/rarity-farming)!

* **Play some Mini-Games:** Some [Mini-Games](/minigames) are already available fren. Check them out!


### Heb ik KYC nodig om Aavegotchi te spelen of om de GHST token te bezitten?

No! You only need to do KYC if you want to buy GHST directly from the [bonding curve](/curve). You can purchase GHST on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH) without KYC, as well as on [certain exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets). Meanwhile, **no KYC** is required to buy [portals](/portals), [play mini-games](/minigames), [stake GHST](/staking), or for any other aspect of the Aavegotchi project itself.

The table below summarizes the information:

table_kyc

### Wat heeft Aave te maken met Aavegotchi?

Aavegotchi began with an Aave ecosystem grant, entrusted with permission to use the Aave ghost logo. The Aavegotchi game incorporates the use of [aTokens](/spirit-force) as a central element of gameplay, and as of November 2020, Aave is also an [official investor](https://medium.com/aave/aave-takes-stake-in-aavegotchis-pixelcraft-studios-a136fbe475f) in Pixelcraft Studios, the team behind Aavegotchi.

### Kunnen de aTokens in een Aavegotchi worden geliquideerd?
No. The aTokens staked inside an Aavegotchi cannot be used as collateral for borrowing on the Aave platform. Thus, such aTokens cannot get liquidated.

### Wat zijn maTokens?
maTokens are aTokens from Aave V2 which have been transferred to Polygon. Like aTokens, they accrue interest over time!

### Kan CAPTCHA worden gebruikt om bots te voorkomen?
No. The [Aaavegotchi.com website](https://aavegotchi.com/) is just an interface. Bots would still easily bypass the interface and interact with the underlying smart contract directly.

This is a feature of permissionless blockchains. It cannot be stopped.

### Zijn amTokens hetzelfde als maTokens?
No. amTokens are **not** the same as maTokens.

maTokens are aTokens from Aave V2 on Ethereum Mainnet that have been represented on Polygon. They are created by [Nick](/team#nick-mudge) to hasten the launch of Aavegotchi on Polygon.

Subsequently, Aave themselves shifted over to Polygon. Tokens from their Aave (Polygon) markets are known as amTokens.

Both categories of tokens will have differing interest rate profiles. For maTokens, their interest rates can be observed in the Aave V2 market. For amTokens, their interest rates can be observed in the Aave market (Polygon).

Aavegotchis belonging to [Haunt](/haunt) 1 use maTokens as their Spirit Force.

From Haunt 2 onwards, amTokens will be used as Spirit Force.

Both maTokens and amTokens accrue interest. However, *the way* they accrue interest differs:

* maTokens increase in **value** over time. This applies to Haunt 1 Aavegotchis that use maTokens. The value of the maTokens are increasing, but as the quantity does not change, it is not possible to withdraw maTokens from the Gotchis unless you sacrifice your Gotchi to get at the underlying collateral.

* amTokens increase in **quantity** over time. This applies to Aavegotchis from Haunt 2 and onwards. The interest accrued is reflected as quantity. Hence, it is possible to withdraw amTokens once sufficient interest has been generated.

### Why can't I swap my assets for maLINK/maUNI on QuickSwap?
QuickSwap has routing problems for a few maTokens such as maUNI and maLINK. You have to manually swap to maUSDC first and then get the respective maToken.

**Doesn't work**: ETH/USDC -> maUNI/maLINK

**Works**: maUSDC -> maUNI/maLINK

### Zal Aavegotchi worden geïntegreerd in OpenSea?
Aavegotchi is fully compatible with OpenSea (and other secondary marketplaces) on Ethereum Mainnet. The challenge is with OpenSea Polygon. When someone puts up a Gotchi for sale on the Baazaar, their wearables are also listed along with the it. OpenSea Polygon does not have this locking mechanism in place. Hence, Gotchi sellers on OpenSea Polygon could rug would-be buyers of the Gotchi's wearables. To protect buyers, Pixelcraft has informed OpenSea that they will not be pursuing a listing on Polygon.

Similarly, there are some constraints with the listing of wearables on OpenSea Polygon. Due to the way OpenSea Polygon parses contracts, they have some difficulties parsing the ERC-1155 wearables. The issue is that the same address holds both ERC-721s (Gotchis) and ERC-1155s (wearables). Their infrastructure is not set up to handle both in the same contract.

### Waar kan ik de Aavegotchi Litepaper vinden?

There are 2 Aavegotchi Litepapers: (1) The Original Litepaper summarizing the key points of the Aavegotchi Project, and (2) The Newest Litepaper introducing the upcoming Gotchiverse and REALM, the land parcels in the Gotchiverse.

They can be found here:

* [Original Litepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTijRP1Rd_Z8iu6IISWCct7TWRdzK3x-lfrucgM_7Cg/edit#heading=h.el8lgo9q7kkr)
* [Aavegotchi REALM Litepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUHF29F3_tByWd8ezSphYEE0gPJYg3K5CN1K-X3_WK8/edit)

## Bonding Curve Veelgestelde Vragen

### Ik heb GHST gekocht, maar ik kan het niet in mijn portefeuille zien
After making a purchase on the bonding curve, you need to make another transaction to claim the GHST tokens. Please see the screenshot below for an example. The user has to click the "CLAIM ORDER" button for the GHST tokens to appear in their wallet.

<img src = "/faq/claim-order.png" class="bodyImage" />

### Can people frontrun the Bonding Curve?
No. When you make purchases/sales of GHST token on the bonding curve, transactions are batched along with other people's transactions before being sent to the smart contract. They are not able to bid on a lower GHST price with a higher gas fee to frontrun your purchase.

## FRENS Veelgestelde Vragen

### Kan ik FRENS kopen?
No. FRENS are a way to reward our community members who staked GHST.

### Worden FRENS voor iets anders gebruikt buiten lotterijen?

No, the only thing FRENS are for is entering Aavegotchi raffles. The rest of the Aavegotchi ecosystem will be powered by GHST.

### What happens to the FRENS on Mainnet after the game launches on Polygon?
Your FRENS balance will be automatically transferred to Polygon. FRENS on Mainnet will then become worthless.

### Waarom levert de GHST-USDC LP 74M FRENS per dag op?
An early depositor in the GHST-USDC pool on QuickSwap messed up the ratio between the assets. Hence, when depositors add to the pool, they receive tiny amounts of LP tokens, like 0.00006. See the tweet [here](https://twitter.com/coderdannn/status/1362423402871447554) for lulz.

## Lotterij Veelgestelde Vragen

See <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">Raffles</a> for general information on raffles.



### Betekent het kopen van een ticket dat ik op de lotterij ben ingevoerd?

No! Please be aware simply buying tickets with FRENS **does not automatically enter you into the raffle.** You need to STAKE your tickets during the 72 hour-time period that the raffle is open. This includes two transactions on the Raffle page - **approve** your tickets, **and enter** your tickets. If you’ve submitted your tickets successfully, you’ll see the number of tickets you’ve entered in the raffle on the Stats page.


### Zullen lotterij wearables beschikbaar zijn in de Aavegotchi winkel?

No. The only time these wearables will ever be released is during the pre-launch raffles.


### Zijn lotterij wearables speciaal?

As far as gameplay, raffle wearables will offer the same <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables">boosts</a> to your Aavegotchi as any other wearables in their rarity class (such as rare, mythical, etc).  On the [Baazaar](/baazaar), whether they have more resale value due to their **pre-launch status** or **brand associations** will be determined by market demand.


### Hoe verplaats je lotterij tickets?
Raffle Tickets are based on the ERC-1155 standard. They can be transferred through the [Tickets page](https://aavegotchi.com/tickets) on the Aavegotchi DApp. Beneath each Ticket category that you own, there will be a Transfer button (see screenshot below). Click on that button to transfer tickets belonging to that category.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/faq/transfer-raffle-tickets.png" alt = "Transfer Aavegotchi Raffle Tickets" />

You will then be brought to another page where you can specify the recipient's address as well as the number of tickets to transfer (see screenshot below). Once you have keyed in the information and confirmed it to be correct, hit the Transfer button.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/faq/transfer-raffle-tickets2.png" alt = "Transfer Aavegotchi Raffle Tickets" />

### Zullen er Lotterijen zijn na Mainnet lancering?
Yes, there will be additional raffles after Mainnet launches. However, they will be infrequent and would not be announced beforehand. This is to reward users who are still staking and accumulating their [FRENS](/glossary#frens) and/or raffle tickets.

## Veiling Veelgestelde Vragen

### Hoeveel kan ik verdienen?
Each GBM auction can be configured with certain presets for maximum earning. For this Wearable auction, we have chosen the same presets used in Cryptographs — minimum 1% , and maximum 10%. This means that the max amount you can earn from being outbid is a full 10% of the bid amount!

For example, if you bid 2000 GHST, the maximum you can earn if outbid in the first GBM auction is 200 GHST. Future Auctions will also be experimenting with different presets to keep it interesting!

### Kan ik mezelf overbieden?
Yes, there is nothing wrong with outbidding yourself to earn the incentive. Just don’t overpay!

### Waarom is de minimale stijging 10%?
This minimum “step” has been carefully calculated by the game theory experts at GBM to ensure the auction remains fully funded no matter how many bids are thrown at it. Without a minimum increase, the auction would be at risk of becoming underfunded.

### Is er een minimum bod?
There is no minimum bid for the Auction. You can bid 1 GHST if you’d like! Just keep in mind, the higher you bid, the more you potentially earn if outbid.

### Wat voorkomt dat bots alle items opvegen?
In a First Come First Serve NFT drop, an automated script can listen for blockchain events and be the first to purchase an item the moment it hits the blockchain.

This speed advantage is fully mitigated by the auction system — bots will NOT be running off with NFTs in an Aavegotchi Aauction!

### Wat voorkomt dat bots het einde van een veiling kunnen saboteren?
If a bid is placed within the last five minutes of the Auction, the “hammer time” is extended by another five minutes. This effectively prevents bots from sniping the end because they can still be outbid.

### Hoe claim ik mijn NFT?
If you’re the highest bidder at the end of the Auction, you’ll see a “Claim NFT” button appear in your My Bids page, which will allow you to claim the NFT directly to your wallet!

## Wearable Veelgestelde Vragen

### Moet ik mijn wearable vouchers overzetten naar Polygon?
No. Both claimed and unclaimed wearable vouchers will be automatically transferred to Polygon when Aavegotchi launches.

### Zijn er beperkte hoeveelheden voor elke wearable?
Yes. Each wearable has a limited quantity. You can check out the quantity at the [Wearables page](/wearables).

For Maall-bought wearables, this means that once a wearable is sold out, it will never be available for sale in the Maall again. You can only purchase it from other people who have that wearable.

### Ik heb de wearables van mijn Aavegotchi uitgedaan en ik kan ze niet vinden in mijn inventaris
Each Aavegotchi has its own inventory, known as a [Gotchi Pocket](/aavegotchi-profile#gotchi-pocket). When you unequip a wearable from your Aavegotchi, the unequipped wearable goes to that particular Aavegotchi's Gotchi Pocket.

You (the owner) have your own separate inventory as well. Most likely, you are referring to the fact that you are not able to find the unequipped wearable in your inventory.

At each [Aavegotchi's Profile page](/aavegotchi-profile), there will be a "Pocket" button at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on it and then transfer the unequipped wearable from the Aavegotchi's Gotchi Pocket to your personal inventory.

### Waarom ontbreken er ID's op de Wearables pagina?
These are objects (IDs 162-198, 210) that are not wearables. They represent [Baadges](/baadge) and the Haunt 1 Background.

## Portaal Veelgestelde Vragen

### Hoeveel portalen kan je kopen in 1 transactie?
Each user can purchase up to 50 portals in 1 transaction. This is to prevent whales from monopolizing a huge number of portals at one ago.

### Als ik een portaal open maar niet de atoken heb die nodig zijn om aanspraak te maken op de gotchi, kan ik dan later nog terugkomen om dat op te eisen?
Yes, you can leave the portal opened, go acquire the specific aToken, and come back later to summon your gotchi. You do not need to prepare the aTokens beforehand.

### Wanneer worden portalen vrijgegeven?
Portals will be released on Polygon at February.

## AavegotchiDAO Veelgestelde Vragen

### Hoe stem ik met Trust Wallet op Aragon?
As at this point, Aragon has not integrated Trust Wallet yet. An alternative solution is to import your private keys from your Trust Wallet into Metamask. Once in Metamask, you can now vote on Aragon.

See [here](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/i-need-to-export-my-trust-wallet-to-metamask-how-do-i-do-this/3194) for more information on how to do so.

### Waarom zegt het een verkeerde tijdstempel in Snapshot stemmen?
This is because the timestamp on your device/computer is different from the timestamp on Snapshot. Set your computer time to automatic and it will adjust accordingly to match with the timestamp on Snapshot.

### Waarom 20% quorum voor Signaal Voorstellen?
A 20% quorum ensures that Signal Proposals with significant community interest are guaranteed a core vote, while ideation and more niche suggestions also have a platform to test their popularity.

### Waarom twee stemmen?
There are two major reasons a Signal Proposal reaching 20% quorum (and majority support) still needs a second vote as a Core Proposal. First, the wider community isn’t watching, or expected to watch, for binding votes on a daily basis. Core Proposals are more rare occurrences that are broadcast across all socials, notifying all types of community members.

Secondly, it is entirely possible, even likely, that some Signal Proposals will achieve quorum while failing to adequately abide by the prescribed template for a Signal Proposal (see [here](/dao#creating-signal-proposals)). There may be a need to adjust the proposal to satisfy all aspects of the template.

**If a Signal Proposal does not reach the 20% quorum, this does not discount the proposal’s merits, it simply means the proposal is not automatically being upgraded to a binding, community wide vote.** Any well-written signal proposal with good ideas should still be considered a healthy contribution to the DAO and may very well influence Pixelcraft and future community proposals. Pixelcraft may occasionally choose Signal Proposals that did not reach quorum and still craft Core Proposals based on them.

### Ik heb al mijn GHST budget gespendeerd aan portalen en Wearables - Wat is mijn stem?
You’re in luck! The Aavegotchi game has always intended to allocate voting power based on Aavegotchi ownership, in addition to just holding GHST. With the passing of [AGIP 9](aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#voting-power-based-on-wearables--maall-price), wearables now have voting power in AavegotchiDAO. The voting power (measured in GHST) of a given wearable is based on its Rarity Type/Maall price. See [here](/wearables#voting-power) for more information.

### Hoe zit het met de financieringsvoorstellen?
Funding requests are not found in the *Cocoon* proposal template, primarily because the “walk before run” principle suggests we focus on establishing a healthy framework before introducing financial complexities.

**Funding Proposals will certainly be a central feature in Metamorphosis but Cocoon’s focus is more on making game mechanics decisions.**

That said, *Cocoon* is an experimental governance phase and it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility to see a good idea garner significant support that does in fact require DAO treasury funds. Any such situation would undoubtedly require a Galaxy level vote and 20% quorum. So basically, we’re not encouraging it, while at the same time remembering that we should never say never.

## Gameplay Veelgestelde Vragen


### Betekent hogere eigenschappen altijd een hogere zeldzaamheid?

Aavegotchi rarity is based on a bell curve - meaning **both extremely high and extremely low** trait scores are desirable. <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Trait scores</a> that fall in the middle of the 0-100 range are more common.

### Hoeveel kost het om te spelen?

Portals are expected to cost 100 GHST for the first haunt. Costs for other items like wearables, consumables and land will be announced as they’re officially released - though after game launch, [the DAO](/dao) will have the power to **adjust asset prices via governance vote**. In the meantime, you can check out what some of the open market prices currently are for certain wearables at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

### Heeft het veranderen van de onderpand invloed op kinship level?
No, increasing or decreasing the collateral/aToken staked in the Aavegotchi does not affect kinship level.

## Aambassador Veelgestelde Vragen

### Do I need to fill out monthly reports as an Aambassador?

No you do not. This Aambassador Program is designed in a way that allows you to focus less on admin tasks and more on building your **#GotchiGang.**

### How big should I grow my #GotchiGang?

Keeping your **#GotchiGang** smaller and specific is actually better. You can create a **#GotchiGang** for your town, your city, your university… creativity is yours!

Once your group reaches 100 legitimate members, you’ll be officially recognized as an Aavegotchi Aambassador.

### What if the #GotchiGang name I want has already been taken by someone else?

We will inform you if the name has already been taken after you have filled up your application on the typeform.

### I already have an Aavegotchi-themed group. Should I apply to become an Aambassador?

Absolutely! As long as we can easily track the growth of your network, you are eligible to be an Aambassador.

### I have a question that isn’t answered here. Where should I ask it?

All questions about the Aambassador program can be directed towards jason@aavegotchi.com, (or buzz.lightyear in Discord).

## Guild FAQ

### What are the differences between Aambassador groups and Guilds?

Aambassador groups are meant to introduce new people to Aavegotchi while Guilds are for existing players to group up and play together in the Gotchiverse.

### How do I submit my Guild to the Guild wiki page?

DM BowtiedNerd#6509 on Discord with all the required information that's in the [Guild wiki page](/guild).

## Bridging FAQ

### Can I still pet my Aavegotchi once it has been bridged back to Ethereum?

**YES**, the developers of Gotchi World and Gotchi Care (Gotchi petting services) have graciously offered to auto-pet all bridged Aavegotchis, ensuring you still earn kinship while your Gotchi is on Ethereum! While vacationing on Ethereum your Aavegotchi will continue to grow its kinship score by two points everyday, but it would definitely appreciate a visit or two from its master! It’s lonely in spaace…

### Can my Aavegotchi still earn Rarity Farming rewards while it is on Ethereum?

**YES**, your Gotchi will still be eligible for Rarity Farming rewards in all three categories while bridged. All rewards will go directly to its pocket.

### Can my Gotchi be bridged over with wearables equipped?

**YES**, you can equip as many wearable as you want before you bridge, BUT do note that your Aavegotchi will not be doing further wardrobe changes while on Ethereum.

### Can my Gotchi equip or unequip wearables while on Ethereum?

**NO**, your Gotchi is basically frozen as a snapshot of the moment it was bridged. However, you can bridge back to Polygon anytime you please (normal bridging charges apply).

### Can I still use my Aavegotchi to play in the upcoming Gotchiverse game while it is on Ethereum?

**NO**, since the Gotchiverse runs on Polygon, any Gotchis on Ethereum Mainnet will not be able to participate in the Gotchiverse. Bridge back over anytime you want to play!

### Can individual Wearables, Portals, and Consumables be bridged to Ethereum and listed on Rarible as well?

**YES** but **NOT YET**. Portals are an immediate yes because they are also ERC-721 tokens. The wearables and consumables are ERC-1155 items and will have their own bridge opening in the coming weeks.

### If I buy a Aavegotchi on Ethereum through Rarible, how do I bridge it back to Polygon?

Simply visit [aavegotchi.com/bridge](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge). You can bridge back anytime you like!

### Can I sell my Aavegotchi on the Baazaar while it’s bridged to Ethereum?
**NO**, you can only trade on Ethereum marketplaces like Rarible while the Aavegotchi is bridged.

### Can I trade my Aavegotchis on OpenSea while they’re on Ethereum?
**YES**, you can trade your Gotchis on any Ethereum-based NFT market, but you’ll only earn RARI when you trade on Rarible!

## Technical FAQ

### Is Aavegotchi on-chain?

All elements of the Aavegotchi game are [stored on the Ethereum blockchain](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1328548543909351429). You can read more about our unique design using the Diamond Standard [here](/glossary#diamond-standard).

### Which wallet should I use with Aavegotchi?

<a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> has by far been the best option to use with Aavegotchi according to our community’s experience. Metamask and [Arkane wallet](https://arkane.network/apps) - which will be integrating with Aavegotchi soon - also both support ERC1155 tokens, meaning you’ll be able to see all of your assets (such as wearables) in your wallet in addition to your GHST tokens.

For android devices, using the Metamask app with the in-built browser is a good choice.

### Will Aavegotchi run on Layer 2?

Yes! Aavegotchi uses [Polygon](https://matic.network/) as a Layer 2 solution. The team selected Polygon as they have a strong team, made progress on decentralization, and what appears to be a strong network effect with other NFT platforms like OpenSea.

### Do I need to migrate my Aave tokens?

Aavegotchi will work with aTokens from [Aave version 2.0](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/aave-has-officially-launched-version-2-of-its-mainnet-with-several-network-upgrades-b34fa0bd111a) - so be sure to migrate any tokens you have on version 1 before trying to claim your Aavegotchi. According to Stani, we [should have a migration tool out soon](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1334546997827809285) (before launch) :)

### How do I migrate to Polygon?
Check out our [Polygon Migration Guide](/polygon).

### I have a ledger / trezor, what do I do?
You could still access Polygon using the Trezor One. For all others, it is not possible for now. You could create a new Metamask wallet and DM @Jesse | gldnXross#6482 for help.

### Why can't I see my Polygon GHST on Metamask?

Make sure you have completed two transactions: (1) approve transaction, and (2) migration from Mainnet to Polygon transaction. The token address for GHST on Polygon is as follows: 0x385Eeac5cB85A38A9a07A70c73e0a3271CfB54A7

### Why can't I see my LP Tokens on QuickSwap?

After you have staked your LP tokens on QuickSwap, you will not be able to see them in your wallet. Unstake them if you want to see them being reflected in your wallet.

### Can I send Polygon-side tokens to Centralized Exchanges directly?
**No!** You should not send Polygon-side tokens to Centralized Exchanges (e.g. Binance, Coinbase, etc) directly. You have to bridge them back into Ethereum Mainnet before doing so.

### Why is Metamask rejecting my token symbol?

Metamask has a maximum limit of 11 characters for their token symbol. You can change the token symbol to something shorter and it will work. Changing the symbol to something shorter does not affect the token; it only affects the display on your Metamask.

Quite a number of people have encountered this issue as the stkGHST-QUICK token symbol has more than 11 characters.

### I withdrew my GHST from Polygon but I have yet to receive them even after a long wait

I withdrew my GHST tokens (or any other assets for that matter) from Polygon back to Ethereum Mainnet using the [Aavegotchi Bridge](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge). After a few hours, I have yet to receive my assets on Ethereum Mainnet. What can I do?

First, head over to the [Polygon Block Explorer](https://explorer.matic.network/) and key in your transaction ID. Obtain the Block Number of your transaction.

Next, replace the [blockNumber] portion in the following URL with your actual Block Number and go to that URL:

https://apis.matic.network/api/v1/matic/block-included/[blockNumber]

That URL will indicate the status of your withdrawal transaction.

If your transaction has not been processed by Polygon, please continue to wait patiently. There have been cases where it took up to 6 hours.

If your transaction has been processed by Polygon and your assets still do not appear on the Aavegotchi Bridge UI, please contact Coderdan (or any other aapprentices) for support.

### Why am I experiencing lag on Polygon?

You might want to try connecting to the other Polygon RPC: https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/

For step-by-step instructions on how to do so, please refer to our [Polygon Guide](/polygon).

### Where do I find my Gotchi Token ID?

To get your Aavegotchi Token ID (each Aavegotchi has a unique ID), head over to the [My Aavegotchis page](https://aavegotchi.com/aavegotchis). Click on one of your Gotchis and observe the number at the back of the URL. It would look something like the following:

https://aavegotchi.com/gotchi/(Gotchi Token ID)

Once you have gotten your Gotchi ID, you can link your Gotchis to your Discord handle using the follow Discord command:

```
!gotchi link <tokenID>
```

Do note that if you have more than 1 Gotchi, you need to repeat the same process for multiple times.

### Where do I find my Gotchi Address?

First, head over to the [My Aavegotchis page](https://aavegotchi.com/aavegotchis). Click on any one of your Aavegotchis. At the bottom-right corner of the screen, there will be a "Pocket" button. Click on the Pocket button and the Gotchi Pocket box will appear. There will be a "View" button. Click on it and you will be taken to that particular Gotchi's Smart Contract Address. This is an escrow contract that the owner of the Gotchi can interact with.

Do note that each Gotchi will have its own Smart Contract Address.
