Wearables are an important component of the Aavegotchi game. Besides endowing your Aavegotchi with a sense of fashion, wearables also boost the Aavegotchi's traits and rarity score, enabling them to perform better in [mini-games](/minigames), as well as in [rarity farming](/rarity-farming).

Wearables conform to the ERC-1155 standard.

This page contains detailed information about every wearable that has been confirmed in the Aavegotchi game.

Design of the wearables are done by [Xibot](/team#xibot) and our team of [community aartists](/aartist).

## Key

Aavegotchis have four traits that can be modified by wearables.

* AGG = Aggressiveness
* NRG = Energy
* SPK = Spookiness
* BRN = Brain Size

The traits of "Eye Color" and "Eye Shape" cannot be modified by wearables.

*Note: Negative values do not mean the trait is getting "weaker". Aavegotchi traits are distributed on a bell curve, so the extremes (0,1) and (99,100) are actually the best!*

See [Traits](/traits) for more about this topic.

## Wearables [Basic Rarity Score (BRS)](/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score)

Wearables can be equipped or unequipped at any time. Equipping/unequipping wearables may affect the [overall rarity](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score) of an Aavegotchi:

## Voting Power

With the passing of [AGIP 9](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#voting-power-based-on-wearables--maall-price), wearables now have voting power in [AavegotchiDAO](/dao). The voting power (measured in GHST) of a given wearable is based on its Rarity Type/[Maall](/maall) price.

## LINK Themed Set

Distributed via an exclusive, limited-edition Raffle in November 2020, these LINK-themed wearables celebrate Aavegotchi's partnership with Chainlink, specifically our use of Chainlink VRF to ensure that Aavegotchis have verifiable, provably random traits.

## Santa Wearables Set

One of our friends accidentally send 4000 LINK (~$50,000) to the GHST Staking Contract. We raised funds from our community to help him out. Everyone who donated more than $20 worth of ANY ERC20 token to SantaGotchi.eth will be airdropped a limited edition Santagotchi Hat. See [here](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1339738554906243072) for more information. Picture for the wearable will be out soon! Other items in the Santa wearables set will be available soon as well.

## OKex Wearables

On 7 October 2020, Aavegotchi partnered with OKex to create a special set of wearables inspired by Jay Hao, the CEO of OKex. Lucky depositors who deposit their GHST tokens on the OKex platform stood a chance to win these wearables. 150 wearables are available. The top 5 depositors will automatically win the full 5 piece set. But the remaining 125 NFTs will be randomly awarded to anyone who deposits more than 10 GHST.
