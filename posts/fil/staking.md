Staking refers to the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in return for rewards. This is no different in the Aavegotchi project. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in the Staking Contract to earn [FRENS](/posts/glossary#frens).

FRENS are a non-transferable balance within the Aavegotchi Staking Contract. FRENS cannot be purchased. They are meant to reward stakers for their contributions to the Aavegotchi project.

FRENS can be converted into Raffle Tickets or Drop Tickets:

* Raffle Tickets can be entered into periodic [Wearable Raffles](/tickets) to win [Wearables](/wearables).

* Drop Tickets can be entered into [NFT Raffles](/tickets) to win [Portals](/portals) and [REALM Parcels](/metaverse).

## Purchasing GHST
First, you need to get your hands on some GHST tokens to stake. Our [GHST token page](/posts/ghst) covers the various ways in which you can get yourself some.

## How to Stake
Once you have some GHST tokens, it is time to stake them! Staking takes place on Polygon (formerly Matic Network).

There are four ways to stake:

1. GHST

2. GHST-QUICK

3. GHST-USDC

4. GHST-ETH

**Important: Staking on Mainnet has been discontinued! Please unstake and restake on Polygon.**

*Note: Pre-sale GHST tokens cannot be staked until they are unlocked.*

### Staking GHST tokens directly

First, you have to transfer your GHST tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, a layer 2 solution.

This is done by using the [Bridge to Polygon Interface](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge). Approve the contract to use your GHST tokens. Once that transaction goes through, input the amount of GHST you would like to transfer to Polygon. Once your transaction has confirmed on Ethereum, it takes roughly 7-8 minutes for your balance to reflect on Polygon. Your balance will update automatically. Please be patient!

Next, you have to configure your Metamask to display your wallet balance. Do refer to this [Polygon Guide](/polygon) for detailed instructions on how one can configure their Metamask wallet to include Polygon.

Connect your Metamask to Polygon and head over to the [Polygon Staking Page](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon) on the Aavegotchi DApp. Approve the contract to use your GHST tokens on Polygon. Once the transaction goes through, input the amount of GHST you would like to deposit. Presto! You are done!

*For every 1 GHST staked in this way, you receive 1 FRENS / Day.*

### Staking GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC

Staking GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC follows the same steps.

The first step involves transferring funds from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, a layer 2 solution.

Do refer to this [Polygon Guide](/polygon) for detailed instructions on how one can configure their Metamask wallet to include Polygon. Next, use the [Aavegotchi Bridge](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge) to transfer GHST and/or other assets to Polygon. The [maTokens Guide](/matokens) will show you how this is done.

Next, become a liquidity provider on either or both the [GHST-QUICK](https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x8b1fd78ad67c7da09b682c5392b65ca7caa101b9) and [GHST-USDC](https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x096c5ccb33cfc5732bcd1f3195c13dbefc4c82f4) pools on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange). You will receive LP tokens in return for your liquidity provision. For people who are interested in staking in the GHST-QUICK pool, you can get some QUICK token from [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange). The most liquid pairs are currently QUICK-UNI, QUICK-WETH, QUICK-USDC, and GHST-QUICK.

Take these LP tokens and stake them in the [Aavegotchi Staking Interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon) to get stkGHST receipt tokens. For the GHST-QUICK and GHST-USDC pools, these stkGHST receipt tokens are named stkGHST-QUICK and stkGHST-USDC, respectively.

For the stkGHST-QUICK receipt token **only**, you can stake them into the Quickswap Rewards pool at [https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick) to earn additional QUICK rewards. The Aavegotchi team is requesting for a similar incentive to be offered for the stkGHST-USDC receipt token.

*For every 1 GHST-QUICK LP token staked in this way, you receive 83 FRENS / Day (the team tries to keep the rate around 30-40% higher than just staking GHST alone. This rate is periodically adjusted up/down without warning to maintain the correct proportion).*

*For every 1 GHST-USDC LP token staked in this way, you receive 74 million FRENS / Day (10% more than just staking GHST).*

Why is there a huge difference in the number of FRENS earned through LP staking compared to staking GHST tokens directly? Staking LP tokens have the risk of [impermanent loss](/glossary#impermanent-loss). You are compensated for the increased risk you take.

Why is the GHST-USDC pool yielding 74 million FRENS a day? An early depositor in the GHST-USDC pool on QuickSwap messed up the ratio between the assets. Hence, when depositors add to the pool, they receive tiny amounts of LP tokens, like 0.00006. See this [tweet](https://twitter.com/coderdannn/status/1362423402871447554) for the lulz.

### Staking GHST-ETH

* Step 1: Go to [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/) and choose > Pools > Add Liquidity.

* Step 2: Deposit GHST and ETH equally into the GHST-ETH liquidity pool.

* Step 3: In return, you receive GHST-WETH LP tokens.

* Step 4: Take those LP tokens and stake them at [aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon](https://aavegotchi.com/stake-polygon)

* Step 5: In return, you earn FRENS points and you get stkGHST-WETH tokens

* Step 6: Deposit those at [dinoswap.exchange](https://dinoswap.exchange/) > Fossil Farms to farm DINO

* BONUS: Send your DINO to the GHST Extinction Pool to earn even more GHST!

For every 1 GHST-ETH LP token staked in this way, you receive 12.08 million FRENS / Day (20% more than just staking GHST).

## Staking Contract Addresses

The following table shows the various staking contract addresses on Polygon. The ghstStaking and stkGHSTQUICK contracts share the same contract address. Do check the contract address first before finalizing any transactions.
