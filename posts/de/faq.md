## Allgemeines FAQ


### Ich bin neu bei Aavegotchi. Wie kann ich nach dem Start spielen?

* **STEP 1:** Buy [GHST](/ghst)

* **STEP 2:** Use GHST to buy a [portal](/portals) or an Aavegotchi from the [Baazaar](/baazaar)

* **STEP 3:** Get some wearables for your Gotchi from the Baazaar

* **STEP 4:** Pet your Gotchi every 12 hours to increase his/her [kinship](/traits#kinship)

* **STEP 5:** Participate in [Rarity Farming](/rarity-farming)

* **STEP 6:** Play some [Mini-Games](/minigames)

* **STEP 7:** Wait for the [Metaverse](/metaverse) to roll out!

You can find an in-depth outline of gameplay <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/gameplay" target = "_blank">here.</a>

### Wann kann ich ein Aavegotchi bekommen?

2 March 2021 on Polygon! The [metaverse](/metaverse) will open shortly after (Q1 2021).

### How much does it cost to play Aavegotchi?
There are a couple of ways to get an Aavegotchi:

* Buy a [portal](/portals) during a portal drop, open it, and [claim](/portals#claiming-an-aavegotchi) the Gotchi by staking the minimum required amount of Spirit Force.

Cost: 100 GHST + 10 DAI worth of collateral minimum (you might need more collateral if you pick a rarer Gotchi from the portal). This option is viable only during portal drops as they get swiped out very quickly.

* Buy an Unopened Portal at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable.

* Buy an Opened Portal at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable, but cheaper than Unopened Portals bought at the Baazaar since the 10 Gotchis in it are already revealed.

* Buy an Aavegotchi from someone else selling it at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

Cost: Variable. Depends on the rarity of the Gotchi, whether it comes with wearables, Baadges, etc.

### When is mainnet launch?
Mainnet was originally scheduled for launch on 4 January 2021. Due to high congestion on the Ethereum blockchain at that point, a community vote was put into action. The community voted for the launch of Aavegotchi on Polygon at a later date. The Aavegotchi team has confirmed the 2 March 2021 launch date on Polygon.


### What can I do now?

Right now, you can:

* **Stake GHST to earn FRENS:** FRENS can be used to purchase raffle tickets to be used in Raffles. Check out the [Staking page](/staking) for more info!

* **Pet your Gotchi evey 12 hours:** Yes! You need to build [Kinship](/traits#kinship) with your Gotchi fren too! The higher the Kinship, the better you do in [Rarity Farming](/rarity-farming)!

* **Play some Mini-Games:** Some [Mini-Games](/minigames) are already available fren. Check them out!


### Do I need KYC to play Aavegotchi or own GHST token?

No! You only need to do KYC if you want to buy GHST directly from the [bonding curve](/curve). You can purchase GHST on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH) without KYC, as well as on [certain exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets). Meanwhile, **no KYC** is required to buy [portals](/portals), [play mini-games](/minigames), [stake GHST](/staking), or for any other aspect of the Aavegotchi project itself.

The table below summarizes the information:

table_kyc

### What does Aave have to do with Aavegotchi?

Aavegotchi began with an Aave ecosystem grant, entrusted with permission to use the Aave ghost logo. The Aavegotchi game incorporates the use of [aTokens](/atokens) as a central element of gameplay, and as of November 2020, Aave is also an [official investor](https://medium.com/aave/aave-takes-stake-in-aavegotchis-pixelcraft-studios-a136fbe475f) in Pixelcraft Studios, the team behind Aavegotchi.

### Can aTokens staked inside an Aavegotchi get liquidated?
No. The aTokens staked inside an Aavegotchi cannot be used as collateral for borrowing on the Aave platform. Thus, such aTokens cannot get liquidated.

### What are maTokens?
maTokens are aTokens from Aave V2 which have been transferred to Polygon. Like aTokens, they accrue interest over time!

### Could CAPTCHA be used to prevent bots?
No. The [Aaavegotchi.com website](https://aavegotchi.com/) is just an interface. Bots would still easily bypass the interface and interact with the underlying smart contract directly.

This is a feature of permissionless blockchains. It cannot be stopped.

### Are amTokens the same as maTokens?
No. amTokens are **not** the same as maTokens.

maTokens are aTokens from Aave V2 on Ethereum Mainnet that have been represented on Polygon. They are created by [Nick](/team#nick-mudge) to hasten the launch of Aavegotchi on Polygon.

amTokens come from the Aave money market pools that is native to Polygon.

Both categories of tokens will have differing interest rate profiles. For maTokens, their interest rates can be observed in the Aave V2 market. For amTokens, their interest rates can be observed in the Aave market (Polygon).

In the Aavegotchi game, the Spirit Force/Collateral used is **maTokens**, and not amTokens.

### Why can't I swap my assets for maLINK/maUNI on QuickSwap?
QuickSwap has routing problems for a few maTokens such as maUNI and maLINK. You have to manually swap to maUSDC first and then get the respective maToken.

**Doesn't work**: ETH/USDC -> maUNI/maLINK

**Works**: maUSDC -> maUNI/maLINK

### Will Aavegotchi be integrated with OpenSea?
Aavegotchi is fully compatible with OpenSea (and other secondary marketplaces) on Ethereum Mainnet. The challenge is with OpenSea Polygon. When someone puts up a Gotchi for sale on the Baazaar, their wearables are also listed along with the it. OpenSea Polygon does not have this locking mechanism in place. Hence, Gotchi sellers on OpenSea Polygon could rug would-be buyers of the Gotchi's wearables. To protect buyers, Pixelcraft has informed OpenSea that they will not be pursuing a listing on Polygon.

Similarly, there are some constraints with the listing of wearables on OpenSea Polygon. Due to the way OpenSea Polygon parses contracts, they have some difficulties parsing the ERC-1155 wearables. The issue is that the same address holds both ERC-721s (Gotchis) and ERC-1155s (wearables). Their infrastructure is not set up to handle both in the same contract.

### Where can I find the Aavegotchi Litepaper?

There are 2 Aavegotchi Litepapers: (1) The Original Litepaper summarizing the key points of the Aavegotchi Project, and (2) The Newest Litepaper introducing the upcoming Gotchiverse and REALM, the land parcels in the Gotchiverse.

They can be found here:

* [Original Litepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTijRP1Rd_Z8iu6IISWCct7TWRdzK3x-lfrucgM_7Cg/edit#heading=h.el8lgo9q7kkr)
* [Aavegotchi REALM Litepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUHF29F3_tByWd8ezSphYEE0gPJYg3K5CN1K-X3_WK8/edit)

## Bonding Curve FAQ

### I bought GHST but I can't see it in my wallet
After making a purchase on the bonding curve, you need to make another transaction to claim the GHST tokens. Please see the screenshot below for an example. The user has to click the "CLAIM ORDER" button for the GHST tokens to appear in their wallet.

<img src = "/faq/claim-order.png" class="bodyImage" />

### Can people frontrun the Bonding Curve?
No. When you make purchases/sales of GHST token on the bonding curve, transactions are batched along with other people's transactions before being sent to the smart contract. They are not able to bid on a lower GHST price with a higher gas fee to frontrun your purchase.

## FRENS FAQ

### Can I buy FRENS?
No. FRENS are a way to reward our community members who staked GHST.

### Are FRENS used for anything besides raffles?

No, the only thing FRENS are for is entering Aavegotchi raffles. The rest of the Aavegotchi ecosystem will be powered by GHST.

### What happens to the FRENS on Mainnet after the game launches on Polygon?
Your FRENS balance will be automatically transferred to Polygon. FRENS on Mainnet will then become worthless.

### Why is the GHST-USDC LP yielding 74M FRENS per day?
An early depositor in the GHST-USDC pool on QuickSwap messed up the ratio between the assets. Hence, when depositors add to the pool, they receive tiny amounts of LP tokens, like 0.00006. See the tweet [here](https://twitter.com/coderdannn/status/1362423402871447554) for lulz.

## Lotterie FAQ

See <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">Raffles</a> for general information on raffles.



### Does buying a ticket mean I'm entered into the raffle?

No! Please be aware simply buying tickets with FRENS **does not automatically enter you into the raffle.** You need to STAKE your tickets during the 72 hour-time period that the raffle is open. This includes two transactions on the Raffle page - **approve** your tickets, **and enter** your tickets. If you’ve submitted your tickets successfully, you’ll see the number of tickets you’ve entered in the raffle on the Stats page.


### Will raffle wearables be available in the Aavegotchi store?

No. The only time these wearables will ever be released is during the pre-launch raffles.


### Are raffle wearables special?

As far as gameplay, raffle wearables will offer the same <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables">boosts</a> to your Aavegotchi as any other wearables in their rarity class (such as rare, mythical, etc).  On the [Baazaar](/baazaar), whether they have more resale value due to their **pre-launch status** or **brand associations** will be determined by market demand.


### How do you transfer raffle tickets?
Raffle Tickets are based on the ERC-1155 standard. They can be transferred through the [Tickets page](https://aavegotchi.com/tickets) on the Aavegotchi DApp. Beneath each Ticket category that you own, there will be a Transfer button (see screenshot below). Click on that button to transfer tickets belonging to that category.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/faq/transfer-raffle-tickets.png" alt = "Transfer Aavegotchi Raffle Tickets" />

You will then be brought to another page where you can specify the recipient's address as well as the number of tickets to transfer (see screenshot below). Once you have keyed in the information and confirmed it to be correct, hit the Transfer button.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/faq/transfer-raffle-tickets2.png" alt = "Transfer Aavegotchi Raffle Tickets" />

### Will there be Raffles after Mainnet launches?
Yes, there will be additional raffles after Mainnet launches. However, they will be infrequent and would not be announced beforehand. This is to reward users who are still staking and accumulating their [FRENS](/glossary#frens) and/or raffle tickets.

## Aauction FAQ

### How much can I earn?
Each GBM auction can be configured with certain presets for maximum earning. For this Wearable auction, we have chosen the same presets used in Cryptographs — minimum 1% , and maximum 10%. This means that the max amount you can earn from being outbid is a full 10% of the bid amount!

For example, if you bid 2000 GHST, the maximum you can earn if outbid in the first GBM auction is 200 GHST. Future Auctions will also be experimenting with different presets to keep it interesting!

### Can I outbid myself?
Yes, there is nothing wrong with outbidding yourself to earn the incentive. Just don’t overpay!

### Why is the minimum increase 10%?
This minimum “step” has been carefully calculated by the game theory experts at GBM to ensure the auction remains fully funded no matter how many bids are thrown at it. Without a minimum increase, the auction would be at risk of becoming underfunded.

### Is there a minimum bid?
There is no minimum bid for the Auction. You can bid 1 GHST if you’d like! Just keep in mind, the higher you bid, the more you potentially earn if outbid.

### What prevents bots from swiping up all the items?
In a First Come First Serve NFT drop, an automated script can listen for blockchain events and be the first to purchase an item the moment it hits the blockchain.

This speed advantage is fully mitigated by the auction system — bots will NOT be running off with NFTs in an Aavegotchi Aauction!

### What prevents bots from being able to snipe the end of an auction?
If a bid is placed within the last five minutes of the Auction, the “hammer time” is extended by another five minutes. This effectively prevents bots from sniping the end because they can still be outbid.

### How do I claim my NFT?
If you’re the highest bidder at the end of the Auction, you’ll see a “Claim NFT” button appear in your My Bids page, which will allow you to claim the NFT directly to your wallet!

## Wearable FAQ

### Do I need to transfer my wearable vouchers to Polygon?
No. Both claimed and unclaimed wearable vouchers will be automatically transferred to Polygon when Aavegotchi launches.

### Are there limited quantities for each wearable?
Yes. Each wearable has a limited quantity. You can check out the quantity at the [Wearables page](/wearables).

For Maall-bought wearables, this means that once a wearable is sold out, it will never be available for sale in the Maall again. You can only purchase it from other people who have that wearable.

### I unequipped the wearables from my Aavegotchi and I cannot find them in my inventory
Each Aavegotchi has its own inventory, known as a [Gotchi Pocket](/aavegotchi-profile#gotchi-pocket). When you unequip a wearable from your Aavegotchi, the unequipped wearable goes to that particular Aavegotchi's Gotchi Pocket.

You (the owner) have your own separate inventory as well. Most likely, you are referring to the fact that you are not able to find the unequipped wearable in your inventory.

At each [Aavegotchi's Profile page](/aavegotchi-profile), there will be a "Pocket" button at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on it and then transfer the unequipped wearable from the Aavegotchi's Gotchi Pocket to your personal inventory.

## Portal FAQ

### How many portals can you buy in 1 transaction?
Each user can purchase up to 50 portals in 1 transaction. This is to prevent whales from monopolizing a huge number of portals at one ago.

### If I open a portal but do not have the atoken needed to claim the gotchi, can I come back later to claim it?
Yes, you can leave the portal opened, go acquire the specific aToken, and come back later to summon your gotchi. You do not need to prepare the aTokens beforehand.

### When will portals be released?
Portals will be released on Polygon at February.

## AavegotchiDAO FAQ

### How do I vote using Trust Wallet on Aragon?
As at this point, Aragon has not integrated Trust Wallet yet. An alternative solution is to import your private keys from your Trust Wallet into Metamask. Once in Metamask, you can now vote on Aragon.

See [here](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/i-need-to-export-my-trust-wallet-to-metamask-how-do-i-do-this/3194) for more information on how to do so.

### Why does it say wrong timestamp in Snapshot Voting?
This is because the timestamp on your device/computer is different from the timestamp on Snapshot. Set your computer time to automatic and it will adjust accordingly to match with the timestamp on Snapshot.

## Gameplay FAQ


### Do higher trait scores always mean higher rarity?

Aavegotchi rarity is based on a bell curve - meaning **both extremely high and extremely low** trait scores are desirable. <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Trait scores</a> that fall in the middle of the 0-100 range are more common.

### How much does it cost to play?

Portals are expected to cost 100 GHST for the first haunt. Costs for other items like wearables, consumables and land will be announced as they’re officially released - though after game launch, [the DAO](/dao) will have the power to **adjust asset prices via governance vote**. In the meantime, you can check out what some of the open market prices currently are for certain wearables at the [Baazaar](/baazaar).

### Does changing the collateral staked affect kinship level?
No, increasing or decreasing the collateral/aToken staked in the Aavegotchi does not affect kinship level.

## Technical FAQ


### Is Aavegotchi on-chain?

All elements of the Aavegotchi game are [stored on the Ethereum blockchain](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1328548543909351429). You can read more about our unique design using the Diamond Standard [here](/glossary#diamond-standard).

### Which wallet should I use with Aavegotchi?

<a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> has by far been the best option to use with Aavegotchi according to our community’s experience. Metamask and [Arkane wallet](https://arkane.network/apps) - which will be integrating with Aavegotchi soon - also both support ERC1155 tokens, meaning you’ll be able to see all of your assets (such as wearables) in your wallet in addition to your GHST tokens.

For android devices, using the Metamask app with the in-built browser is a good choice.

### Will Aavegotchi run on Layer 2?

Yes! Aavegotchi uses [Polygon](https://matic.network/) as a Layer 2 solution. The team selected Polygon as they have a strong team, made progress on decentralization, and what appears to be a strong network effect with other NFT platforms like OpenSea.

### Do I need to migrate my Aave tokens?

Aavegotchi will work with aTokens from [Aave version 2.0](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/aave-has-officially-launched-version-2-of-its-mainnet-with-several-network-upgrades-b34fa0bd111a) - so be sure to migrate any tokens you have on version 1 before trying to claim your Aavegotchi. According to Stani, we [should have a migration tool out soon](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1334546997827809285) (before launch) :)

### How do I migrate to Polygon?
Check out our [Polygon Migration Guide](/polygon).

### I have a ledger / trezor, what do I do?
You could still access Polygon using the Trezor One. For all others, it is not possible for now. You could create a new Metamask wallet and DM @Jesse | gldnXross#6482 for help.

### Why can't I see my Polygon GHST on Metamask?

Make sure you have completed two transactions: (1) approve transaction, and (2) migration from Mainnet to Polygon transaction. The token address for GHST on Polygon is as follows: 0x385Eeac5cB85A38A9a07A70c73e0a3271CfB54A7

### Why can't I see my LP Tokens on QuickSwap?

After you have staked your LP tokens on QuickSwap, you will not be able to see them in your wallet. Unstake them if you want to see them being reflected in your wallet.

### Can I send Polygon-side tokens to Centralized Exchanges directly?
**No!** You should not send Polygon-side tokens to Centralized Exchanges (e.g. Binance, Coinbase, etc) directly. You have to bridge them back into Ethereum Mainnet before doing so.

### Why is Metamask rejecting my token symbol?

Metamask has a maximum limit of 11 characters for their token symbol. You can change the token symbol to something shorter and it will work. Changing the symbol to something shorter does not affect the token; it only affects the display on your Metamask.

Quite a number of people have encountered this issue as the stkGHST-QUICK token symbol has more than 11 characters.

### I withdrew my GHST from Polygon but I have yet to receive them even after a long wait

I withdrew my GHST tokens (or any other assets for that matter) from Polygon back to Ethereum Mainnet using the [Aavegotchi Bridge](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge). After a few hours, I have yet to receive my assets on Ethereum Mainnet. What can I do?

First, head over to the [Polygon Block Explorer](https://explorer.matic.network/) and key in your transaction ID. Obtain the Block Number of your transaction.

Next, replace the [blockNumber] portion in the following URL with your actual Block Number and go to that URL:

https://apis.matic.network/api/v1/matic/block-included/[blockNumber]

That URL will indicate the status of your withdrawal transaction.

If your transaction has not been processed by Polygon, please continue to wait patiently. There have been cases where it took up to 6 hours.

If your transaction has been processed by Polygon and your assets still do not appear on the Aavegotchi Bridge UI, please contact Coderdan (or any other aapprentices) for support.

### Why am I experiencing lag on Polygon?

You might want to try connecting to the other Polygon RPC: https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/

For step-by-step instructions on how to do so, please refer to our [Polygon Guide](/polygon).

### Where do I find my Gotchi Token ID?

To get your Aavegotchi Token ID (each Aavegotchi has a unique ID), head over to the [My Aavegotchis page](https://aavegotchi.com/aavegotchis). Click on one of your Gotchis and observe the number at the back of the URL. It would look something like the following:

https://aavegotchi.com/gotchi/(Gotchi Token ID)

Once you have gotten your Gotchi ID, you can link your Gotchis to your Discord handle using the follow Discord command:

```
!gotchi link <tokenID>
```

Do note that if you have more than 1 Gotchi, you need to repeat the same process for multiple times.

### Where do I find my Gotchi Address?

First, head over to the [My Aavegotchis page](https://aavegotchi.com/aavegotchis). Click on any one of your Aavegotchis. At the bottom-right corner of the screen, there will be a "Pocket" button. Click on the Pocket button and the Gotchi Pocket box will appear. There will be a "View" button. Click on it and you will be taken to that particular Gotchi's Smart Contract Address. This is an escrow contract that the owner of the Gotchi can interact with.

Do note that each Gotchi will have its own Smart Contract Address.
