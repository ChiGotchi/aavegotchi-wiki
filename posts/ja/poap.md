## POAPとは？

The POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a system that event organizers can use to distribute crypto-badges (ERC-721 tokens) to people that show up to their event. It also provides an open standard for developers to build on.

POAPs not only have cool designs and allow you to brag your badges with everyone, your collection acts as a digital proof of representation without providing any explicit personal data.

## Origins

In June 2021, our fren GotchiLove highlighted that the [dev team at POAP has created a Snapshot plugin allowing voters to be rewarded with POAP Badges](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/poap-plugin-for-snapshot-votes/1932).

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xd28d1927cbcee262fe8a4cd4c2363e5ac1c313e893caef40600c9c536817311e) was made to introduce POAP badges for Snapshot voting and it passed.

Members who are interested to contribute to the POAP design process can check out this [Discourse thread](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/poap-design-process/2854).
